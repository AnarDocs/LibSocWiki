The **Herat Uprising** was an anti Pashtun
[uprising](List_of_Revolutions.md "wikilink") and
[mutiny](List_of_Mutinies.md "wikilink") that took place in and around the
city of Herat, [Afghanistan](Afghanistan.md "wikilink") in March
[1979](Revolutions_of_1979_-_1980.md "wikilink"). It was an uprising
against the new Pashtun dominated [Communist
government](Socialist_Afghanistan.md "wikilink"), and the rebels managed to
seize the city with Iranian support for a week before it was taken back
by the government.

## Background

The uprising was largely triggered around the anger of failed land
reform, which saw many peasants become poorer. In addition, anger at the
inclusion of communist propaganda as a part of literacy programs
(justified) and the creation of schools that had mixed-gender classes
(unjustified). As such, the uprising was a mixture of anger at
authoritarianism, left-wing values and economic injustice.

## Events

The uprising began on the 15th of March, as people overwhelmed the
police and attacked government buildings, the army was sent in and soon
defected. The city held, but there was extensive looting and the killing
of suspected communist sympathisers (particulary teachers) and Russians.
The government disguised its soldiers as fellow rebels, and snuck into
the city as it was bombed and attacked from the inside, with between
3,000 and 25,000 being killed in the fighting. Ironically, one of the
leaders of the uprising was a [Maoist](Maoism.md "wikilink"). 4,000 Iranian
Soldiers disguised as rebels were also involved in the uprising.

## Aftermath

Although seemingly a minor event, this was one of the main factors
behind the USSR intervening in Afghanistan, which permanently changed
Afghanistan forever and arguably contributed to the fall of the USSR. In
addition, [Iran](Iran.md "wikilink") and the DRA's relationship reached a
new low with the DRA threatening to cut off water supply to Iran and
Iran threatening the DRA of using their Soviet ally to intimidate Iran.
