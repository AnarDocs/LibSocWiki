**Existentialist Anarchism** is a synthesis of
[anarchism](anarchism "wikilink") and
[existentialism](existentialism "wikilink"), arguing that existentialism
provides a philosophical grounding for anarchist politics, the evidence
being that many existentialist thinks gravitated towards anarchism. This
tradition is largely intellectual, and not a practical guide for
anarchist politics.

rejection of society and it's very

[state](State_(Polity) "wikilink"), private property, religion, gender,
monogamy and money) in favour of the formation of a [union of
egoists](Union_of_Egoists "wikilink"), stating that there is nothing to
look after but yourself, and to be a being of love and happiness.
