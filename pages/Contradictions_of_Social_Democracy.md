This article outlines the **contradictions of social democracy**, or the
ways in which [socially democratic](Social_Democracy "wikilink")
governments contradict their own values. As such, this article takes
representative democracy, regulated capitalism, the welfare state,
police, trade unions and reformism as justified. Even if as libertarian
socialists we have our own critiques of these concepts. This page will
overlap significantly with the [contradictions of
liberalism](contradictions_of_Liberalism "wikilink").
