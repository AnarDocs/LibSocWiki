The **Carnation Revolution** or **Portoguese Revolution of 1974** refers
to a military coup and the resulting unrest which brought down the
[fascist regime](Estado_Novo_(Portugal).md "wikilink") in
[Portugal](Portugal.md "wikilink") and led to numerous progressive reforms
and nearly created
[self-management](Workers'_Self-Management.md "wikilink") in industry.
Occurring on the [25th of April,
1974](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Southern_Europe.md "wikilink"),
the revolution [was part of a wider chain of global revolts against
authoritarian governments and
cultures](Revolutions_of_1967_-_1975.md "wikilink").

## Background

The Carnation Revolution had several causes, notably:

- Conscription of thousands of young men into the unpopular Portuguese
  Colonial War
- Growing popularity of leftist ideas among the south

## Events

### Military Coup

### Near-Revolution

Portugal

### US Interference

An excerpt from [William Blum's](William_Blum.md "wikilink") book [Rogue
State](Rogue_State_(Book).md "wikilink") provides the best summary [US
interference](Timeline_of_US_Imperialism.md "wikilink"):

> A bloodless military coup in 1974 brought down the US-supported
> 48-year fascist regime that was the world's only remaining colonial
> power. This was followed by a program centered on nationalization of
> major industries, [workers'
> control](Workers'_Self-Management.md "wikilink"), a minimum wage, land
> reform and other progressive measures. Washington and multinational
> officials who were on the board of directors of the planet were
> concerned. Destabilization became the order of the day: covert
> actions; attacks in the US press; subverting trade unions; subsidizing
> opposition media; economic sabotage through international credit and
> commerce; heavy financing of selected candidates in elections; a US
> cut-off of Portugal from certain military and nuclear information
> commonly available to NATO members; NATO naval and air exercises off
> the Portuguese coast, with 19 NATO warships moored in Lisbonâ€™s harbor,
> regarded by most Portuguese as an attempt to intimidate the
> provisional government. The Portuguese revolution was doomed. The
> CIA-financed candidates took and retained power for years.

## Results

### Socio-Economic Development

The new Portugal, while very flawed, saw major gains following the end
of the dictatorship, notably:

- Creation of a [socially democratic](Social_Democracy.md "wikilink")
  universal healthcare and education system.
- Excellent [medical services](Healthcare.md "wikilink"), reduction of
  infant mortality from 55.5 per 1,000 births (around 5.5%) in 1970 to
  2.5 per 1,000 births (around 0.2%) in 2010. In 1970 there were 94
  doctors per 100,000 people and in 2011 there was 405 per 100,000
  people.
- Illiteracy went from 26% in 1970 to 5% in 2010.
- High school enrollment for teenagers increased from 3.8% in 1970 to
  71% in 2010.
- Major expansions of [water](water.md "wikilink") and electrical systems,
  in 1970 only 47% of households had access to piped water and only 68%
  had access to [electricity](electricity.md "wikilink"). In 1991 that rose
  to 86% of households with access to piped water and 98% with
  electricity.

### Decolonisation

The revolution led to the [decolonisation](decolonisation.md "wikilink") of
the [Portuguese Empire](Portuguese_Empire.md "wikilink") which then held
several territories in Africa. This also led to the end of the
[Portuguese Colonial War](Portuguese_Colonial_War.md "wikilink"). In 1975
[Indonesia](Indonesia.md "wikilink") invaded and
[occupied](Indonesian_Occupation_of_East_Timor.md "wikilink") the
Portuguese province of Portuguese Timor ([East
Timor](East_Timor.md "wikilink")) in Asia before independence could be
granted. Nearly 1 million Portuguese or persons of Portuguese descent
left these former colonies as refugees. The massive exodus of the
Portuguese military and citizens from Angola and Mozambique, would
prompt an [era of chaos](Angolan_Civil_War.md "wikilink") and [severe
destruction](Mozambican_Civil_War.md "wikilink") in those territories after
independence from Portugal in 1975.
