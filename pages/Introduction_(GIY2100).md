The **Introduction**to the book [Glimpses into the Year
2100](Glimpses_into_the_Year_2100_(Book) "wikilink") is a brief
introduction to the book by [Ilan Shalif](Ilan_Shalif "wikilink"),
talking about [Kibbutzim](Kibbutzim "wikilink").

## Introduction

The “glimpses” are a way to make the world commune of communities of the
[libertarian communist](Anarcho-Communism "wikilink")
[society](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Societies "wikilink") less
abstract... It is based on the big experiment of kibbutzes —the communes
movements of
[Palestine](Palestine "wikilink")-[Israel](Israel "wikilink") of about
94 years, my following it since age 7, and living within it age 16 to
32. Nearly non of the members of the kibbutzes were libertarian
communists.. Most of them were first of all
[Zionists](Zionism "wikilink") of various trends, But, till it started
to deteriorate, the internal relations among the members were
libertarian communists and the decision making was mainly [direct
democracy](Democratic_Assembly "wikilink"). (At the present, most of the
kibbutzes are in the process of
[privatization](Privatisation "wikilink").)
