**Open Borders** are [borders](Border.md "wikilink") that enable free
movement of people between states and communities. In otherwords, no
visas, no bureaucracy, no passports, no queues and no checkpoints.

## History

*See Also: [History of Borders](History_of_Borders.md "wikilink")*

Although open borders arguably existed for most of human history (for
example, migration of forager communities) and borders are an incredibly
new development, with no US-Mexican border existing until the 1870s.

The USA can also be seen as an example of open borders, as the borders
between states within the USA are unrestricted as one can drive from
California to Florida.

The largest and most stable example of open borders from recent history
is the [Schengen area](Schengen_Area.md "wikilink"), developed by the
[European Union](European_Union.md "wikilink") in 1995 and at one point
allowing around 420 million people to freely travel from
[Portugal](Portugal.md "wikilink") to [Finland](Finland.md "wikilink"), with
restrictions being reintroduced from 2015 to 2020, as it more or less
collapsed due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](Coronavirus_Pandemic.md "wikilink").

## Debate

### Moral Debates

- **For:**Open borders are morally justified given that nationality or
  place of birth does not grant more 'worth' to someones life or the
  right for them to freely travel.

### Practical Debates

- **For:**Open borders would life the wealth of much of the Global South
  as workers could travel to countries where they are paid significantly
  more for doing the same work.
- **For:** Open borders would lead to political reforms in poorer and
  more oppressive countries to prevent brain drains, which is what
  happened to [Estonia in
  2012](Estonian_Health_Worker_Strike_(2012).md "wikilink").
- **Against**: Open borders will led to lower wages and worse working
  conditions since they increase the [reserve army of
  labor](Reserve_Army_of_Labour.md "wikilink").
- **Against:** Open borders could lead to greater destruction of the
  environment given that it allows for more people to live middle-class
  lifestyles.
- **Against:**Open borders can erode cultures and feelings of national
  sovereignty, which is a bad thing as it decreases trust in a society.
