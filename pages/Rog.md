**Rog** or the **Republic of Rog** is an abandoned bike
[factory](factory.md "wikilink") in Ljubljana,
[Slovenia](Republic_of_Slovenia.md "wikilink") which during
[2006](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Southern_Europe.md "wikilink")
was turned into a [squat](Squatting.md "wikilink") and [social
center](Social_Center.md "wikilink").

## History

The building had originally been used as a tannery from 1871 to 1945,
where it changed hands between capitalists as they variously died or
went bankrupt. But after [World War II](World_War_II.md "wikilink"), the
tannery was [nationalized](Nationalization.md "wikilink") by the [League of
Communists in Yugoslavia](League_of_Communists_in_Yugoslavia.md "wikilink")
and converted into a bike factory, where it was run as a [self-managed
factory](Workers'_Self-Management.md "wikilink") between 1953 and 1991.

The factory lay abandoned and dormant for 15 years, until the squatters
decided to come in, fix it up and convert it into a social center in
2006. Now the city has also sponsored the construction of several art
and recreational spaces within the spot. However, in 2016, the city
government wished to dismantle the site to be used by capitalists, but
was blocked by the local court.[^1]
