**Maasina Ruru** or **Rule of Relationship of Siblings Together** was an
[indigenist](Indigenism "wikilink") movement moving for self-governance,
social and economic equality, labor rights and preservation of
indigenous culture in the [Solomon Islands](Solomon_Islands "wikilink")
between [1943 and 1953](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism "wikilink").

## Background

The [indigenous people](Indigenous_People "wikilink") on the Solomon
Islands had faced the destruction of their land and culture, massacres
to stop rebellion, exploitation of their labor and [racial
segregation](Racism "wikilink") for hundreds of years. With the theft of
[communal lands](Commons "wikilink"), many had been forced to work in
[factories](Factory "wikilink") during [World War
II](World_War_II "wikilink") just to get enough of a
[wage](Wage_Slavery "wikilink") to buy their right to
[food](Hunger "wikilink"), [water](water "wikilink") and
[shelter](Housing "wikilink").

## Events

Maasina Ruru began in 1943 as
[anti-colonial](Anti-Colonialism "wikilink"),
[anti-racist](Anti-Racism "wikilink") and
[anti-capitalist](Anti-Capitalism "wikilink") sentiment rose among
factory [workers](Working_Class "wikilink") in the Solomon Islands. They
developed a manifesto and began spreading it around the islands
indigenous population, there was a [general
strike](General_Strike "wikilink") in 1945 demanding the wages of
plantation workers be increased by 1200%, which led to the arresting of
protest leaders and thousands of indigenous protesters in 1947 by
British authorities. As such, villagers declared autonomy and [refused
to pay taxes](Tax_Refusal "wikilink") and sabotage of workplaces became
common. Mass arrests became common, but the indigenous people stood
their ground and began [blocking](Blockade "wikilink") roads and
villages across the country, leading to eventual negotiations.[^1][^2]

## Results

The movement led to the bettering of workers' rights, the creation of
dozen of autonomous villages, the releasing of all political prisoners
and an indigenous council to represent their voices in 1953.
