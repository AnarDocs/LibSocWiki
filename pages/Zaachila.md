**Villa de** **Zaachila** is a small town in [Oaxaca,
Mexico](Mexico "wikilink") which has [been
run](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Societies "wikilink") via [popular
assemblies](Democratic_Assembly "wikilink") since
[2006](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Central_America "wikilink").
However, the existing government still remains, making it an example of
[dual power](Dual_Power "wikilink").

## Background

[Environmentalist groups](Environmentalism "wikilink") in the town had
been struggling against the construction of a Coca Cola factory which
would've destroyed much of the towns [water supply](Water "wikilink")
for years. This formed a strong network of activists and sense of
community among town citizens.

## Revolution

During the [Oaxaca Revolution](Oaxaca_Revolution "wikilink"), many
residents met at the towns church (called by ringing bells) and
discussed the news of police brutality and what their town should do.
They eventually agreed to take over the town hall, kicking out the mayor
and using unlocked offices and hallways. Out of this, a tradition of
popular assembly was born.

## Decision-Making

According to an anonymous activist and citizen of the town, decisions
are made using democratic assemblies:

> We’d say, “It’s the neighborhood of La Soledad’s turn and tomorrow
> it’s up to San Jacinto.” That’s how the neighborhood assemblies were
> first used, and then later they turned into decision-making bodies,
> which is where we are now. The seizing of the municipal building was
> totally spontaneous. The activists from before played a role and
> initially directed things, but the popular assembly structure was
> developed little by little...Neighborhood assemblies, comprised of a
> rotating body of five people, were also formed in each section of town
> and together they would form the permanent popular assembly, the
> People’s Council of Zaachila. The people from neighborhood assemblies
> may not be activists at all, but little by little, as they follow
> their obligation to bring information back and forth from the Council,
> they develop their capacity for leadership. All the agreements made in
> the Council are studied by these five people and then brought back to
> the neighborhoods for review. These assemblies are completely open;
> anyone can attend and have their voice heard. Decisions always go to a
> general vote, and all the adults present can vote. For example, if
> some people think a bridge needs to be built, and others think we need
> to focus on improving electricity, we vote on what the priority should
> be. The simple majority wins,fifty percent plus one.

The townsfolk kicked out the mayor while maintaining public services,
and also established a community radio station.
