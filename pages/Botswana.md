**Botswana** is a [liberal](Liberalism "wikilink")
[capitalist](Capitalism "wikilink") [state](List_of_States "wikilink")
in Southern Africa, bordered by [South Africa](South_Africa "wikilink"),
[Namibia](Namibia "wikilink"), Angola, [Zambia](Zambia "wikilink") and
Zimbabwe. Botswana is notable for being one of two countries in Africa
that has never experienced a dictatorship or civil war (the other being
[Mauritius](Mauritius "wikilink")) after being decolonised by the
[British Empire](British_Empire "wikilink").

## Positives

## Negatives

- Botswana has the third highest AIDS rate in the world, with around 20%
  of the population suffering from it (however, this could possibly be
  due to the fact that Botswana has better testing measures)
- The government mistreats the indigenous San people severely, often
  confiscating traditional lands and forcing them into resettlement
  camps
- The country is suffering severe desertification and water overuse

## History

### Independence

Following Indepedence, Botswana was in dire straits. The country was
considered the third poorest in the world with a GDP per capita of \$75
a year. There were only 12 kilometres of paved road. In addition, great
natural resouces wealth (in the form of diamonds) had just been
discovered

When the British left, there were 12 kilometers of paved road, 22
Batswana who had graduated from University and 100 from secondary
school.2Botswana is a predominantly tropical, landlocked country (which
many economists see as a disadvantage, e.g., Bloom and Sachs, 1998). It
is true that diamonds have been important for growth in Botswana, and
currently account for around 40 percent of the country's output. Yet, in
many other countries, natural resource abundance appears to be a curse
rather than a blessing (e.g., Sachs and Warner, 1995). So how did
Botswana do it?
