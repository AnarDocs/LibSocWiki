The **Darwin Rebellion** was a period of massive unrest in Darwin,
[Australia](Australia "wikilink") in
[1918](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Oceania "wikilink").

## Background

The Northern Territory had lost all voting rights in the Australian
government in 1911, the price of beer had jumped 30% in the 1910s, the
region became economically depressed as people lost jobs due to
industries shutting down and the insulting and condescending nature of
the premier, Dr Gilruth.[^1]

## Events

On the afternoon of the 17th of December 1918, workers' across the city
went on strike and 1,000 of them (Darwin had 1,339 people) walked to
government house, demanding "no taxation without representation"
(echoing the [American Revolution](American_Revolution "wikilink"))
behind a car carrying an effigy of Gilruth tied to a stake and calling
for his resignation and greater democratic rights in the Northern
Territory.

Dr Gilruth said that he would not and did not recognise the citizens of
Darwin as having any authority over him. The crowd outside became tense
and impatient. Part of the picket fence around Government House
collapsed and union leader Harold Nelson reportedly called out "over the
fence boys". The crowd advanced across the garden into Government House.
For a few moments, Gilruth was assaulted as he attempted to flee into
the residence. Windows were broken and the wire netting removed from the
tennis court.

Eventually, the crowd dispersed, but not before they carried Gilruth's
effigy to the front gate of Government House, soaked it in kerosene and
set it alight. The Government was alarmed, and within a week of the
incident the navy ship HMAS *Una* arrived to protect Dr Gilruth, and he
left for Melbourne, ending the rebellion.[^2]

## Results

The rebellion led to greater democratic rights for the Northern
Territory.
