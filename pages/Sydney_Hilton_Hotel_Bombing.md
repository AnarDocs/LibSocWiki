The **Sydney Hilton Hotel bombing** occurred in 1978 when a bomb
exploded in a bin outside the Hilton Hotel in Sydney, New South Wales,
[Australia](Australia.md "wikilink"). At the time the hotel was the site of
the first Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting (CHOGRM), a
regional offshoot of the biennial meetings of the heads of government
from across the Commonwealth of Nations (a group of 53 states formerly
part of the British Empire). Many have alleged the bombing was done by
the [ASIO](ASIO.md "wikilink").

## Evidence of a Conspiracy

- There was a continuous police presence outside the building since the
  previous morning. This would have prevented anyone placing a large
  bomb into the rubbish bin while the police were there.
- The driver of the garbage truck, Bill Ebb, stated that the bins would
  normally be emptied several times each day, but police had prevented
  three earlier trucks from emptying the bin that contained the bomb
  even though it was overflowing with rubbish.
- The garbage bin had not been searched for bombs. Searching bins is
  normally a high priority, and is specified in New South Wales police
  permanent circular 135.
- Army dog handler Keith Burley said that his dogs could smell very
  small quantities of explosives, and were expected to be used for the
  event. He said they were unexpectedly called off a few days prior
  without explanation.
- The entire truck and all bomb fragments were dumped immediately
  afterwards at an unrecorded location. This prevented forensic
  evidence, such as the type of explosive used, from being gathered.
  (This was compared to the detailed evidence retrieved from the Pan Am
  Flight 103 that exploded at 30,000 feet.)
- William Reeve-Parker provided a statutory declaration that an army
  officer had admitted planting the bomb by switching rubbish bins 24
  hours earlier. Reeve-Parker denied knowledge of who the officer was,
  although he "had helped his son". Reeve-Parker was never called as a
  witness at the coronial inquest.

- The officer-in-charge of police immediately after the bombing,
  Inspector Ian MacDonald, claimed there had been a "cover-up".
- Former Attorney General of New South Wales Frank Walker and Federal
  Government Senator Gareth Evans had been told by a CSIRO (Australia's
  science agency) scientist that under pressure from ASIO they had made
  two fake bombs in the week prior to the bombing. The bombs were
  designed not to explode but could do so in a garbage truck compactor.
- The principal private secretary of a federal senator was told that the
  bomb squad was waiting nearby at this early hour of the morning. That
  would suggest that they knew about the bomb. The government would not
  permit people from the bomb squad to be called as witnesses to the
  inquest.

- Sgt Horton stated that he saw an occurrence pad entry that showed the
  warning call was received at 12:32, 8 minutes before the bomb
  exploded. It was not relayed instantly to the police out front. At the
  inquest four other versions of this pad were shown, each timing the
  call at 12:40.
