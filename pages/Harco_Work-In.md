The **Harco Work-In** was an episode of [workers'
control](Workers'_Self-Management "wikilink") in a steel factory in
Sydney, [Australia](Commonwealth_of_Australia "wikilink") in
[1971](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Oceania "wikilink").

## Background

Harco was a steel [factory](factory "wikilink") that depended on
government contracts to survive. As these were completed,
[management](Bosses "wikilink") would fire and rehire
[workers](Working_Class "wikilink") as contracts came in, and before
they were fired they were given extraordinary amounts of work to do.
After the firing of six workers, a [strike](strike "wikilink") occurred.
The strikers informally gathered at a nearby pub and that simply
striking would lead to more sackings. Inspired by the recent events in
[France](May-June_1968_Events_in_France "wikilink") and
[Scotland](Upper_Clyde_Shipbuilders_Work-In "wikilink"), they decided to
perform a [work-in](Work-In "wikilink").[^1]

## Events

Under workers' control, the Harco factory saw a 25% increase in
productivity, which management refused to pay the workers for.[^2]

## Results

The Harco Work-In failed as Harco repeatedly sabotaged the operation by
stealing tools and supplies whilst randomly shutting off
[electricity](electricity "wikilink") to the factory. They also went to
the state and got them to fine the Harco workers, who were still willing
to continue the work-in. But the refusal for the [reformist
union](Trade_Union "wikilink") to support the action combined with
heavier fines eventually ended the work-in, which achieved none of its
gains and cost the workers their jobs. However, it inspired a wave of
work-ins across Australia which continued through the 1970s.[^3]
