The **Red Army Faction** (or **RAF** or **Baader–Meinhof Group** or
**Baader–Meinhof Gang**) was a
[Marxist-Leninist](Marxist-Leninism.md "wikilink") terrorist group based in
[Germany](Germany.md "wikilink") from 1970 to 1998.

## History

### Background

Born out of the revolts in the late 1960s that swept the world and an
alienated movement of young students. The RAF drew inspiration from
successful guerrilla groups in the third world, the
[Chinese](Chinese_Revolution.md "wikilink") and [Cuban
Revolutions](Cuban_Revolution.md "wikilink") as well as the
[Tupamaros](Tupamaros.md "wikilink") and Palestinian guerrillas. It also
drew ideological inspiration from anti-colonial writers like [Ho Chi
Minh](Ho_Chi_Minh.md "wikilink") and [Frantz
Fanon](Frantz_Fanon.md "wikilink") as well as the Frankfurt School (notably
[Habermas](Jurgen_Habermas.md "wikilink"),
[Marcuse](Herbert_Marcuse.md "wikilink") and [Negt](Oskar_Negt.md "wikilink"))
and early [Autonomism](Autonomism.md "wikilink") and
[Situationism](Situationism.md "wikilink").

Notably, the unique conditions of Germany helped shaped the RAF. Not
only were many students becoming disillusioned with capitalism,
alienation and imperialism. But also the presence of many former Nazis
who went unpunished in high profile positions of power, Germany's
support for the [US Empire](Timeline_of_US_Imperialism.md "wikilink") and
[Israel](Israel.md "wikilink") and the killing of left-wing student leader
[Rudi Dutschke](Rudi_Dutschke.md "wikilink") by a right-winger. Not only
this result in the RAF but a strong ecosystem of left-wing organisations
such as [Kommune 1](Kommune_1.md "wikilink"), [Kommune
2](Kommune_2.md "wikilink"), [Kommune 3](Kommune_3.md "wikilink"), the
[Socialist Patients'
Collective](Socialist_Patients'_Collective.md "wikilink"), the
[APO](Auserparlamentarische_Opposition.md "wikilink"), [Amon
Düül](Amon_Duul.md "wikilink") the [German Students
Movement](German_Students'_Movement.md "wikilink") and
[Squatters](Squatting#Germany.md "wikilink"). These ecosystems
progressively declined due to frustration of a lack of change and
infighting, with most developing into various anarchist and communist
terrorist groups.

The RAF are yet another example of why and how
[terrorism](terrorism.md "wikilink") (especially by the left) fails, and
how we as leftists must do everything in our power to stop terrorism.
