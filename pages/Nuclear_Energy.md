**Nuclear Energy** or **Nuclear Power** is a way of generating
[electricity](electricity.md "wikilink") that involves the use of nuclear
reactions that release nuclear energy to generate heat, which most
frequently is then used in steam turbines to produce electricity in a
nuclear power plant.

## Benefits

- Nuclear energy can produce reliable, cheap and large amounts of
  electricity quickly.
- Nuclear energy emits little to no pollution.
- Nuclear energy has the lowest rate of death of any large-scale power
  source.
- Nuclear Power Plants use the least amount of land of any clean energy
  source. Solar power requires 75x more space and wind power requires
  360x more space.[^1]

## Costs

- There is only enough nuclear fuel (mainly uranium) to power the world
  for a few hundred years. If human civilisation is to survive, it will
  run out eventually, and we will have to find
  [alternatives](Renewable_Energy.md "wikilink").[^2]
- It takes a lot of time, money and expertise to set up nuclear energy
  plants and decommissioning them (making them safe once they get too
  old) also
- Nuclear waste can take thousands of years to safely decompose and
  requires specially designed spaces to store, if it is exposed to
  people or the environment, it creates massive health and ecological
  problems.
- [Nuclear accidents](List_of_Nuclear_Accidents.md "wikilink"), while rare,
  create massive health and ecological crises that kill thousands of
  people.
