The **Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities** or **Municipios
Autónomos Rebel des Zapatistas** (**MAREZ**) are an [autonomous
society](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Societies.md "wikilink") within the
Mexican state that emerged as a result of the [Zapatista
Revolution](Zapatista_Revolution.md "wikilink") in
[1994](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism.md "wikilink") inspired by the
[indigenist](Indigenism.md "wikilink") ideology of
[Neo-Zapatismo](Neo-Zapatismo.md "wikilink"). They control roughly a third
of the [Mexican](Mexico.md "wikilink") state of Chiapas with a population
of around 360,000 people.[^1]

## Decision-Making

At a local level, people attend a [popular
assembly](Democratic_Assembly.md "wikilink") of around 300 families where
anyone over the age of 12 can participate in decision-making, these
assemblies strive to reach a [consensus](consensus.md "wikilink") but are
willing to fall back to a majority vote.

Each community has 3 main administrative structures: (1) the
*commissariat*, in charge of day-to day administration; (2) the *council
for land control*, which deals with forestry and disputes with
neighboring communities; and (3) the *agencia*, a community police
agency.

The communities form a [confederation](confederation.md "wikilink") with
other communities to create an autonomous municipalities, which form
further confederations with other municipalities to create a region. The
Zapatistas are composed of five regions, who in turn form the whole of
MAREZ.[^2]

The symbol of the caracol - the snail, sums up the Zapatistas. The idea
behind the choice of symbol is simple: the snail is defensive by nature,
but the spiral pattern of its shell represents how EZLN ideology will
radiate from caracol enclaves like Oventic. Most importantly, the snail
is content to take its time.

## Foreign Relations

The Zapatista Communities are marked by a tense relationship with the
Mexican or 'bad government' (as opposed to the zapatista 'good
government' or 'autonomous government') as well as various multinational
banks and corporations, drug cartels, fascist groups, the CIA (who
support Mexico and cartels on behalf of the US). All of these tensions
and occasional violent confrontations are known as the [Chiapas
Conflict](Chiapas_Conflict.md "wikilink").

Entry to the Zapatista Communities is quite easy provided you can get
into Mexico and Chiapas, according to one visitor of the communities:

> A masked Zapatistas checked my credentials, took down my name, and
> directed me past the line of guards. Nobody was armed with anything
> more than batons.[^3]

## Crime

Each community has an autonomous police agency (agencia), more akin to a
[neighborhood watch](Neighborhood_Watch.md "wikilink"), and a judicial
council. There is almost no [crime](crime.md "wikilink") and
[prison](prison.md "wikilink") population, due to an emphasis on
[restorative](Restorative_Justice.md "wikilink") and [transformative
justice](Transformative_Justice.md "wikilink") over [punitive
justice](Punitive_Justice.md "wikilink") and due to [common
ownership](Commons.md "wikilink") of land preventing
[hunger](hunger.md "wikilink"), the [control of
work](Workers'_Self-Management.md "wikilink") and
[education](Democratic_Education.md "wikilink"). The only two people in
jail (in a society of 360,000, which means they have the lowest prisoner
population per capita in the world) are in jail for being admitted
foreign agents planting marijuana crops to justify military incursions
into their communities using the [war on drugs](War_on_Drugs.md "wikilink")
as a pretext.[^4]

## Economy

The economy is mainly composed of [worker
cooperatives](Worker_Cooperative.md "wikilink"), family farms and community
stores with the councils of good government providing low-interest
loans, free education, radio stations and health-care to communities.
The economy is largely self-reliant and agricultural, producing mainly
corn, beans, coffee, bananas, sugar, cattle, chickens, pigs and clothing
at cooperatives. The communities have abolished private (but not
personal) ownership of property and instituted a system of [common
ownership of land](Commons.md "wikilink"), and they sell over \$44 million
worth of goods to international markets each year.[^5]

## Public Services

### Education

The Zapatistas run hundreds of schools with thousands of teachers
modeled around the principles of [democratic
education](Democratic_Education.md "wikilink") where students and
communities collectively decide on school curriculum and students are
not subjects to grading. On average, the Zapatistas have more schools
than the surrounding indigenous communities governed by the right-wing
PRI.[^6]

### Healthcare

All communities elect a local health committee in what are described as
‘simple town meetings’ to provide necessary and adequate oversight of
community medical services. Based on the healthcare demands of the local
community inhabitants, the health committee drafts a healthcare policy
that responds directly to the needs of the community that the community
then approves on (or is free to modify, engaging in a loop with doctors
of revision, updating and improvement). Committees form federations to
help coordinate resources and share information to improve the health
services in the whole of the Zapatista community.

The Zapatistas enjoy a three-tiered healthcare system, containing the
‘health houses’ at a local level, capable of providing basic medical
care and examinations to all people quickly, health clinics (referred to
as ‘micro-clinics’) contain access to maternity and birthing rooms, a
fully stocked pharmacy, a twenty-four hour emergency room, an operating
theatre and equipment to conduct eye tests. Hospitals (referred to as
central clinics) are more rare but provide access to dental care, a
pharmacy and a laboratory for medical tests. For women, this clinic also
provides specialised services like gynaecology and maternity wards.

Some major healthcare achievements made by the Zapatistas include:

- The eradication of both the manufacture and consumption of alcohol, 
  directly linked to the reduction in many illnesses and infections
  including ulcers, cirrhosis, malnutrition and surgical wounds
- In 2010, 63% of all expectant mothers were able to receive medical
  assistance in Zapatista communities, while only 35% of pregnancies are
  properly assisted in non-Zapatista communities
- In regions where there were previously significantly high rates of
  death during childbirth, there has now been a period of eight years or
  more where no maternal deaths have been recorded (a lower rate than
  Australia, Finland and Japan, world leaders in medicine).
- In 2013, 84% of Zapatista communities received important vaccinations
  against diseases such as malaria. In pro-government communities that
  figure stands at only 75%.
- Cancer screenings and sexual health examinations take place more
  frequently
- In 2013, 32% of Zapatista inhabitants suffer TB while in larger
  portions of pro-government communities, a remarkable 84%, continue to
  experience this respiratory infection
- In 2010, 74% of Zapatista communities had access to toilet facilities,
  leading to a vast improvement in personal hygiene. Only 54% of
  pro-government communities can claim access to toilet facilities in
  their homes.[^7]

Residents of the Zapatisa communities believe their health services are
better staffed, equipped and less racist towards indigenous people than
most services in Chiapas. It also works with surrounding hospitals and
freely takes in patients from other communities who need to use the
medical facilities that only the Zapatistas have.[^8] Since 1994, the
Zapatistas have built 2 new hospitals and 18 health clinics in the
region to increase the well-being of communities.[^9]

According to one account of Oventic from 2016 “there was a small yet
seemingly fully-functional medical clinic, which appeared to offer basic
healthcare. A sign on the door said general consultations, gynecology,
optometry and laboratory services were all available five days a week.
Emergency services were available 24 hours, seven days a week. They
appeared to have a shiny new ambulance at their disposal. Other services
offered a few days a week included dentistry and ultrasounds.”[^10]

## Environmental Protection

The Zapatistas have taken on many projects to protect and restore the
damaged ecosystems of the Lacandon Jungle, including the banning of
chemical fertilisers and pesticides, as well as resisting the extraction
of oil and metal through mining. According to one person who stayed in
the town of Oventic:

> There was also something else — something which took me a long time to
> put my finger on. Then it finally hit me: there was no litter; not
> even a stray chocolate bar wrapper.[^11]

The Zapatistas have also embarked on beekeeping and reforestation
efforts, having planted over 30,000 trees in order to protect water
sources (especially important given the increasing water scarcity in
Chiapas)[^12], reverse deforestation in the rainforests and provide
sources of food, fuel and construction material.[^13] Beekeepers aim to
reverse much of the collapse of the bee population, and produce honey
for food, ecological regeneration and candles.[^14]

## Culture

Take the following story, which is characteristic of the emancipatory
social change that has been taking place in the Zapatista communities of
Chiapas over the past 20 years; a story that is not visible in any
official statistics.

> A Basque friend I met in Chiapas a couple of years ago told me that
> what had impressed him the most during his last visit to the Zapatista
> communities was the position of women. The Basque comrade had come to
> Chiapas for the first time in 1996, two years after the uprising, and
> he could still vividly remember that women used to walk 100 meters
> behind their husbands, and whenever the husband would stop, they would
> stop as well to maintain their distance. Women would be exchanged for
> a cow or a corn field when they were married off—not always to the man
> of their choice. The situation has been very neatly depicted in the
> Zapatista movie <em>Corazon del Tiempo</em>.

> Almost 20 years later, my Basque friend returned to Chiapas for the
> first grade of the Escuelita Zapatista. This time he would freely
> dance with the <em>promotoras</em> after the events, while some of the
> highest-ranking EZLN commanders—or to be more precise for the lovers
> of statistics: 50 percent of the Commanders of the Clandestine
> Revolutionary Indigenous Committee—are actually women.

> In addition, women are now forming their own cooperatives contributing
> to family and community income; they are becoming the promoters of
> education (teachers, that is), nurses and doctors; and they serve as
> members of the Good Government Councils, or <em>Juntas de Buen
> Gobierno</em>, and as guerrillas.

In terms of LGBT rights:

> In one of the Zapatista <em>caracoles</em>, there is now a music band
> called Otros Amores (“Other Loves”). Otros Amores is the phrase the
> Zapatistas use for the members of the LGBTQ community. All this in a
> previously deeply conservative, <em>machista</em> region (and
> country). Just try to imagine something similar in the rest of
> Mexico—or wherever you may be coming from!
