The **Tambov Rebellion** was a [peasant
uprising](Peasants#List_of_Peasant_Revolts "wikilink") against the
Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War.

## Defeat

The Bolsheviks employed the use of armoured trains, heavy artillery,
poison gas and the mass execution of civilians. Around 240,000 civilians
had been killed by 1921 and 50,000 were placed in [concentration
camps](Concentration_Camp "wikilink").
