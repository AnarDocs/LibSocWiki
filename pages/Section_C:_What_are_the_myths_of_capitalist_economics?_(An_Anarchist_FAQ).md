## Transcript

Within capitalism, economics plays an important ideological role.
Economics has been used to construct a theory from which exploitation
and oppression are excluded, by definition. We will attempt here to
explain why capitalism is deeply exploitative. Elsewhere, in [section
B](Section_B:_Why_do_anarchists_oppose_the_current_system?_(An_Anarchist_FAQ).md "wikilink"),
we have indicated why capitalism is oppressive and will not repeat
ourselves here. In many ways economics plays the role within capitalism
that religion played in the Middle Ages, namely to provide
[justification](Religious_Authority.md "wikilink") for the dominant social
system and hierarchies.“The priest keeps you docile and subjected,”
argued [Malatesta](Errico_Malatesta.md "wikilink"), “telling you everything
is God’s will; the economist say it’s the law of nature.” They “end up
saying that no one is responsible for poverty, so there’s no point
rebelling against it.” [\[Fra Contadini]([Fra_Contadini.md "wikilink"), p.
21\]

Even worse, they usually argue that collective action by [working class
people](Working_Class.md "wikilink") is counterproductive and, like the
priest, urge us to tolerate current oppression and exploitation with
promises of a better future (in heaven for the priest, for the economist
it is an unspecified “long run”). It would be no generalisation to state
that if you want to find someone to rationalise and justify an obvious
injustice or form of oppression then you should turn to an economist
(preferably a “free market” one). That is not the only similarity
between the “[science](science.md "wikilink")” of economics and religion.
Like religion, its basis in science is usually lacking and its theories
more based upon “leaps of faith” than empirical fact. Indeed, it is hard
to find a “science” more unconcerned about empirical evidence or
building realistic models than economics.

Just looking at the assumptions made in “perfect competition” shows that
(see [section
C.1](C.1_What_is_wrong_with_economics?_(An_Anarchist_FAQ).md "wikilink")
for details). This means that economics is immune to such trivialities
as evidence and fact, although that does not stop economics being used
to rationalise and justify certain of these facts (such as
[exploitation](exploitation.md "wikilink") and inequality). A classic
example is the various ways economists have sought to explain what
anarchists and other socialists have tended to call “[surplus
value](Surplus_Value.md "wikilink")” (i.e. [profits](Profit.md "wikilink"),
[interest](interest.md "wikilink") and [rent](rent.md "wikilink")). Rather
than seek to explain its origin by an empirical study of the society it
exists in (capitalism), economists have preferred to invent “just-so”
stories, little a-historic parables about a past which never existed is
used to illustrate (and so defend) a present class system and its
inequalities and injustices. The lessons of a fairy tale about a society
that has never existed are used as a guide for one which does and, by
some strange co-incidence, they happen to justify the existing class
system and its distribution of income.

Hence the love of Robinson Crusoe in economics.Ironically, this
favouring of theory (ideology would be a better term) is selective as
their exposure as fundamentally flawed does not stop them being
repeated. As we discuss in section C.2, the [neoclassical theory of
capital](Neoclassical_Theory_of_Capital.md "wikilink") was proven to be
incorrect by left-wing economists. This was admitted by their opponents:
“The question that confronts us is not whether the [Cambridge
Criticism](Cambridge_Capital_Controversy.md "wikilink") is theoretically
valid. It is. Rather the question is an empirical or econometric one: is
there sufficient substitutability within the system to establish
neo-classical results?” Yet this did not stop this theory being taught
to this day and the successful critique forgotten. Nor has econometrics
successfully refuted the analysis, as capital specified in terms of
[money](money.md "wikilink") cannot reflect a theoretical substance
(neo-classical “capital”) which could not exist in reality. However,
that is unimportant for “\[u\]ntil the econometricians have the answer
for us, placing reliance upon neo-classical economic theory is a matter
of faith, ”which, of course, he had \[C. E. Ferguson,The Neo-classical
Theory of Production and Distribution, p. 266 and p. xvii\]

Little wonder that [Joan Robinson](Joan_Robinson.md "wikilink"), one of the
left-wing economists who helped expose the bankruptcy of the
neo-classical theory of capital, stated that economics was “back where
it was, a branch of theology.”\[Collected Economic Papers, Vol. 4, p.
127\] It remains there more than thirty years later: “Economics is not a
science. Many economists — particularly those who believe that decisions
on whether to get married can be reduced to an equation — see the world
as a complex organism that can be understood using the right
differential calculus. Yet everything we know about economics suggests
that it is a branch and not a particularly advanced one, of witchcraft.”
\[Larry Elliot and Dan Atkinson, [The Age of
Insecurity](The_Age_of_Insecurity_(Book).md "wikilink"), p. 226\]

The weakness of economics is even acknowledged by some within the
profession itself. According to Paul Ormerod, “orthodox economics is in
many ways an empty box. Its understanding of the world is similar to
that of the physical sciences in the Middle Ages. A few insights have
been obtained which stand the test of time, but they are very few
indeed, and the whole basis of conventional economics is deeply flawed.”
Moreover, he notes the “overwhelming empirical evidence against the
validity of its theories.” It is rare to see an economist be so honest.
The majority of economists seem happy to go on with their theories,
trying to squeeze life into the Procrustean bed of their models. And,
like the priests of old, make it hard for non-academics to question
their dogmas as “economics is often intimidating. Its practitioners ...
have erected around the discipline a barrier of jargon and mathematics
which makes the subject difficult to penetrate for the
non-initiated.”[The Death of
Economics]([The_Death_of_Economics_(Book).md "wikilink"), p. ix, p. 67 and
p. ix\]

So in this section of our FAQ, we will try to get to the heart of modern
capitalism, cutting through the ideological myths that supporters of the
system have created around it. This will be a difficult task, as the
divergence of the reality of capitalism and the economics that is used
to explain (justify, more correctly) it is large. For example, the
preferred model used in neo-classical economics is that of “perfect
competition” which is based on a multitude of small firms producing
homogenous products in a market which none of them are big enough to
influence (i.e. have no market power). This theory was developed in the
late 19th century when the real economy was marked by the rise of big
business, a dominance which continues to this day.

Nor can it be said that even small firms produce identical products —
product differentiation and brand loyalty are key factors for any
business. In other words, the model reflected (and still reflects) the
exact opposite of reality. In spite of the theoretical models of
economics having little or no relation to reality, they are used to both
explain and justify the current system. As for the former, the truly
staggering aspect of economics for those who value the scientific method
is the immunity of its doctrines to empirical refutation (and, in some
cases, theoretical refutation). The latter is the key to not only
understanding why economics is in such a bad state but also why it stays
like that. While economists like to portray themselves as objective
scientists, merely analysing the system, the development of their
“science” has always been marked with apologetics, with rationalising
the injustices of the existing system.

This can be seen best in attempts by economists to show that [Chief
Executive Officers](Boss.md "wikilink") (CEOs) of firms, capitalists and
[landlords](Landlord.md "wikilink") all deserve their riches while workers
should be grateful for what they get. As such, economics has never been
value free simply because what it says affects people and society. This
produces a market for economic ideology in which those economists who
supply the demand will prosper. Thus we find many “fields of economics
and economic policy where the responses of important economic
professionals and the publicity given economic findings are correlated
with the increased market demand for specific conclusions and a
particular ideology.” [\[Edward S.
Herman]([Edward_S._Herman.md "wikilink"), “The Selling of Market
Economics,” pp. 173–199, New Ways of Knowing, Marcus G. Raskin and
Herbert J. Bernstein (eds.), p.192\]

Even if we assume the impossible, namely that economists and their
ideology can truly be objective in the face of market demand for their
services, there is a root problem with capitalist economics. This is
that it the specific social relations and classes produced by capitalism
have become embedded into the theory. Thus, as an example, the concepts
of the [marginal productivity](Marginal_Productivity_Theory.md "wikilink")
of [land](land.md "wikilink") and [capital](Capital_(Economics).md "wikilink")
are assumed to universal in spite the fact that neither makes any sense
outside an economy where one class of people owns the means of life
while another sells their labour to them. Thus in an artisan/peasant
society or [one based around co-operatives](Mutualism.md "wikilink"), there
would be no need for such concepts for in such societies, the
distinction between [wages](Wage_Labour.md "wikilink") and profits has no
meaning and, as a result, there is no income to the owners of machinery
and land and no need to explain it in terms of the “marginal
productivity” of either.

Thus mainstream economics takes the class structure of capitalism as a
natural, eternal, fact and builds up from there.
[Anarchists](Anarchism.md "wikilink"), like [other
socialists](Libertarian_Socialism.md "wikilink"), stress the opposite,
namely that capitalism is a specific [historical
phase](Economic_Stages.md "wikilink") and, consequently, there are no
universal economic laws and if you change the system the laws of
economics change. Unless you are a capitalist economist, of course, when
the same laws apply no matter what. In our discussion, it is important
to remember that capitalist economics is not the same as the capitalist
economy. The latter exists quite independently of the former (and,
ironically, usually flourishes best when the policy makers ignore it).
Dissident economist [Steve Keen](Steve_Keen.md "wikilink") provides a
telling analogy between economics and meteorology. Just as “the climate
would exist even if there were no intellectual discipline of
meteorology, the economy itself would exist whether or not the
intellectual pursuit of economics existed.” Both share “a fundamental
raison d’etre,” namely “that of attempting to understand a complex
system.”

However, there are differences. Like weather forecasters, “economists
frequently get their forecasts of the economic future wrong. But in
fact, though weather forecasts are sometimes incorrect, overall
meteorologists have an enviable record of accurate prediction — whereas
the economic record is tragically bad.” This means it is impossible to
ignore economics (“to treat it and its practitioners as we these days
treat astrologers”) as it is a social discipline and so what we “believe
about economics therefore has an impact upon human society and the way
we relate to one another.” Despite “the abysmal predictive record of
their discipline,” economists “are forever recommending ways in which
the institutional environment should be altered to make the economy work
better.” By that they mean make the real economy more like their models,
as “the hypothetical pure market performs better than the mixed economy
in which we live.” [Debunking
Economics]([Debunking_Economics_(Book).md "wikilink"), pp. 6–8\]

Whether this actually makes the world a better place is irrelevant
(indeed, economics has been so developed as to make such questions
irrelevant as what happens on the market is, by definition, for the
best). Here we expose the apologetics for what they are, expose the
ideological role of economics as a means to justify, indeed ignore,
exploitation and oppression. In the process of our discussion we will
often expose the ideological apologetics that capitalist economics
create to defend the status quo and the system of oppression and
exploitation it produces. We will also attempt to show the deep flaws in
the internal inconsistencies of mainstream economics. In addition, we
will show how important reality is when evaluating the claims of
economics. That this needs to be done can be seen by comparing the
promise of economics with its actual results when applied in reality.

Mainstream economics argues that it is based on the idea of “utility” in
consumption, i.e. the subjective pleasure of individuals. Thus
production is, it is claimed, aimed at meeting the demands of consumers.
Yet for a system supposedly based on maximising individual happiness
(“utility”), capitalism produces a hell of a lot of unhappy people. Some
radical economists have tried to indicate this and have created an
all-embracing measure of well-being called the [Index of Sustainable
Economic Welfare](Index_of_Sustainable_Economic_Welfare.md "wikilink")
(ISEW). Their conclusions, as summarised by Elliot and Atkinson, are
significant: “In the 1950s and 1960s the ISEW rose in tandem with per
capita GDP. It was a time not just of rising incomes, but of greater
social equity, [low crime](Crime.md "wikilink"), [full
employment](Unemployment#Full_Employment.md "wikilink") and [expanding
welfare states](Social_Democracy.md "wikilink"). But from the mid-1970s
onwards the two measures started to move apart. GDP per head continued
its inexorable rise, but the ISEW started to decline as a result of
lengthening dole queues, social exclusion, the explosion in crime,
habitat loss, environmental degradation and the growth of environment-
and stress-related illness. By the start of the 1990s, the ISEW was
almost back to the levels at which it started in the early 1950s.”
\[Larry Elliot and Dan Atkinson, Op. Cit., p. 248\]

So while capitalism continues to produce more and more goods and,
presumably, maximises more and more individual utility, actual real
people are being “irrational” and not realising they are, in fact,
better off and happier. Ironically, when such unhappiness is pointed out
most defenders of capitalism dismiss people’s expressed woe’s as
irrelevant. Apparently some subjective evaluations are considered more
important than others! Given that the mid-1970s marked the start of
[neoliberalism](neoliberalism.md "wikilink"), the promotion of the market
and the reduction of government interference in the economy, this is
surely significant. After all, the “global economy of the early 21st
century looks a lot more like the economic textbook ideal that did the
world of the 1950s ... All these changes have followed the advance of
economists that the unfettered market is the best way to allocate
resources, and that well-intentioned interventions which oppose market
forces will actually do more harm than good.” As such, “\[w\]ith the
market somuch more in control of the global economy now than fifty years
ago, then if economists are right,the world should be a manifestly
better place: it should be growing faster, with more stability, and
income should go to those who deserve it.” However, “\[u\]nfortunately,
the world refuses to dance the expected tune. In particularly, the final
ten years of the 20th century were marked, not by tranquil growth, but
by crises.” \[Steve Keen,Op. Cit., p. 2\]

These problems and the general unhappiness with the way society is going
is related to various factors, most of which are impossible to reflect
in mainstream economic analysis. They flow from the fact that capitalism
is a system marked by inequalities of wealth and power and so how it
develops is based on them, not the subjective evaluations of atomised
individuals that economics starts with. This in itself is enough to
suggest that capitalist economics is deeply flawed and presents a
distinctly flawed picture of capitalism and how it actually works.
Anarchists argue that this is unsurprising as economics, rather than
being a science is, in fact, little more than an ideology whose main aim
is to justify and rationalise the existing system.

We agree with [libertarian Marxist](Libertarian_Marxism.md "wikilink")
[Paul Mattick’s](Paul_Mattick.md "wikilink") summation that economics
is“actually no more than a sophisticated apology for the social and
economic status quo”and hence the“growing discrepancy between \[its\]
theories and reality.”[Economics, Politics and the Age of
Inflation]([Economics,_Politics_and_the_Age_of_Inflation_(Book).md "wikilink"),
p. vii\] Anarchists, unsurprisingly, see capitalism as a fundamentally
exploitative system rooted in inequalities of power and wealth dominated
by hierarchical structures (capitalist firms). In the sections that
follow, the exploitative nature of capitalism is explained in greater
detail. We would like to point out that for anarchists, exploitation is
not more important than domination. Anarchists are opposed to both
equally and consider them to be two sides of the same coin. You cannot
have domination without exploitation nor exploitation without
domination. As [Emma Goldman](Emma_Goldman.md "wikilink") pointed out,
under capitalism: “wealth means power; the power to subdue, to crush, to
exploit, the power to enslave,to outrage, to degrade ... Nor is this the
only crime ... Still more fatal is the crime of turning the producer
into a mere particle of a machine, with less will and decision than his
master of steel and iron. Man is being robbed not merely of the products
of his labour, but of the power of free initiative, of originality, and
the interest in, or desire for, the things he is making.” [Red Emma
Speaks]([Red_Emma_Speaks_(Book).md "wikilink"), pp. 66–7\]

Needless to say, it would be impossible to discuss or refute every issue
covered in a standard economics book or every school of economics. As
economist [Nicholas Kaldor](Nicholas_Kaldor.md "wikilink") notes,“\[e\]ach
year new fashions sweep the ‘politico-economic complex’ only to
disappear again with equal suddenness... These sudden bursts of fashion
are a sure sign of the ‘pre-scientific’ stage \[economics is in\], where
any crazy idea can get a hearing simply because nothing is known with
sufficient confidence to rule it out.”\[The Essential Kaldor, p. 377\]
We will have to concentrate on key issues like the flaws in mainstream
economics, why capitalism is exploitative, the existence and role of
economic power, the [business cycle](Business_Cycle.md "wikilink"),
unemployment and inequality. Nor do we wish to suggest that all forms of
economics are useless or equally bad. Our critique of capitalist
economics does not suggest that no economist has contributed worthwhile
and important work to social knowledge or our understanding of the
economy. Far from it. As [Bakunin](Mikhail_Bakunin.md "wikilink") put it,
property “is a god” and has "its metaphysics. It is the science of the
bourgeois economists. Like any metaphysics it is a sort of twilight, a
compromise between truth and falsehood, with the latter benefiting from
it. It seeks to give falsehood the appearance of truth and leads truth
to falsehood.” [The Political Philosophy of
Bakunin]([The_Political_Philosophy_of_Bakunin_(Book).md "wikilink"), p.
179\]

How far this is true varies form school to school, economist to
economist. Some have a better understanding of certain aspects of
capitalism than others. Some are more prone to apologetics than others.
Some are aware of the problems of modern economics and “some of the most
committed economists have concluded that, if economics is to become less
of a religion and more of a science, then the foundations of economics
should be torn down and replaced”(although,“left to \[their\] own
devices”, economists “would continue to build an apparently grand
edifice upon rotten foundations.”). \[Keen, Op. Cit., p. 19\] As a rule
of thumb, the more free market a particular economist or school of
economics is, the more likely they will be prone to apologetics and
unrealistic assumptions and models. Nor are we suggesting that if
someone has made a positive contribution in one or more areas of
economic analysis that their opinions on other subjects are correct or
compatible with anarchist ideas.

It is possible to present a correct analysis of capitalism or capitalist
economics while, at the same time, being blind to the problems of
[Keynesian economics](Keynesian_Economics.md "wikilink") or the horrors of
[Stalinism](Marxist-Leninism.md "wikilink"). As such, our quoting of
certain critical economists does not imply agreement with their
political opinions or policy suggestions. Then there is the issue of
what do we mean by the term “capitalist economics”? Basically, any form
of economic theory which seeks to rationalise and defend capitalism.
This can go from the extreme of free market capitalist economics (such
as the so-called [“Austrian”
school](Austrian_School_of_Economics.md "wikilink") and Monetarists) to
those who advocate state intervention to keep capitalism going
(Keynesian economists). We will not be discussing those economists who
advocate state capitalism. As a default, we will take “capitalist
economics” to refer to the mainstream “neoclassical” school as this is
the dominant form of the ideology and many of its key features are
accepted by the others.

This seems applicable, given that the current version of capitalism
being promoted is neo-liberalism where state intervention is minimised
and, when it does happen, directed towards benefiting the ruling elite.
Lastly, one of the constant refrains of economists is the notion that
the public is ignorant of economics. The implicit assumption behind this
bemoaning of ignorance by economists is that the world should be run
either by economists or on their recommendations. In [section
C.11](C.11_Doesn’t_neo-liberalism_in_Chile_prove_that_the_free_market_benefits_everyone?_(An_Anarchist_FAQ).md "wikilink")
we present a case study of a nation, [Chile](Chile.md "wikilink"), unlucky
enough to have that fate subjected upon it. Unsurprisingly, this rule by
economists could only be imposed as a result of a [military
coup](Chilean_Military_Coup_(1973).md "wikilink") and [subsequent
dictatorship](Pinochet_Dictatorship.md "wikilink"). As would be expected,
given the biases of economics, the wealthy did very well, workers less
so (to put it mildly), in this experiment.

Equally unsurprising, the system was proclaimed an economic miracle —
before it promptly collapsed. So this section of the FAQ is our modest
contribution to making economists happier by making working class people
less ignorant of their subject. As Joan Robinson put it: “In short, no
economic theory gives us ready-made answers. Any theory that we follow
blindly will lead us astray. To make good use of an economic theory, we
must first sort out the relations of the propagandist and the scientific
elements in it, then by checking with experience, see how far the
scientific element appears convincing, and finally re-combine it with
our own political views. The purpose of studying economics is not to
acquire a set of ready-made answers to economic questions, but to learn
how to avoid being deceived by economists.”\[Contributions to Modern
Economics, p. 75\]
