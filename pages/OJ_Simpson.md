**Orenthal James Simpson,**nicknamed "**the Juice**", is an American
former football running back, broadcaster, actor, advertising spokesman,
and convicted felon. Once a popular figure with the U.S. public, he is
most well known today for his trial and acquittal, as well as his
wrongful death conviction, for the murders of his former wife Nicole

controversial, and opened up discussions on race, gender, police and
conspiracy in the USA.
