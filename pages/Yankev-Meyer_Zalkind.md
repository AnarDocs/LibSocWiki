**Yankev-Meyer Zalkind** (1875 - 1937) was a [Jewish Orthodox
rabbi](Judaism.md "wikilink"), an
[anarcho-communist](Anarcho-Communism.md "wikilink") and a close friend of
[Rudolf Rocker](Rudolf_Rocker.md "wikilink").

## Life

Yankev was born in the Russian Empire to a family of famous merchants
and rabbis. He was a highly successful [student](student.md "wikilink") and
went on to study [linguistics](Language.md "wikilink") and philosophy in
Germany, France and Switzerland and became able to speak over 20
languages.[^1]

After graduating, Yank left for Britain and served as rabbi of Cardiff,
Wales and was an active [Zionist](Zionism.md "wikilink"). In 1913 he formed
a London Estate and began buying land in Israel with the hopes of
setting up Jewish communities in the area.[^2]

During World War I he underwent a spiritual transformation and began to
advocate for [anarchism](anarchism.md "wikilink"). In 1916 he left Israel
in order to go to London as a [peace
campaigner](Anti-War_Movement.md "wikilink"). He befriended [Rudolf
Rocker](Rudolf_Rocker.md "wikilink") in this time and began to advocate for
the creation of an [anarchist
society](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Societies.md "wikilink") in the
Levant which could shelter the world's refugees.[^3]

He also became a prominent hebrew-[language](language.md "wikilink")
writer, writing Jewish childrens books and attempted to translate the
Talmud into Yiddish.[^4] He also argued rigorously that the logical
conclusion of the teachers of the Talmud was anarchism.[^5] He moved
back to Israel in 1933 and died in Haifa in 1937.[^6]
