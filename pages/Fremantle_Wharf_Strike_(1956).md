[strike](List_of_Strikes "wikilink") by dockworkers in Perth, [Western
Australia](Commonwealth_of_Australia "wikilink") over a lack of wage
increases for four years. Workers blocked 29 ships from exiting the
port, resulting in the strike being declared illegal and 2,000
dockworkers and firefighters being dismissed.[^1][^2]
