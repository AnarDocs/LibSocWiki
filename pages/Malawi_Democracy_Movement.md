The **Malawi Democracy Movement** was a [social
movement](Social_Movement.md "wikilink") aimed at overthrowing
[Malawi's](Malawi.md "wikilink") dictatorship and creating a
[liberal](Liberalism.md "wikilink") [multi-party
democracy](Representative_Democracy.md "wikilink") that began in
[1992](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Southern_Africa.md "wikilink").

## Background

[Hastings Kamuzu Banda](Banda_Dictatorship_(Malawi).md "wikilink") had been
the dictator of Malawi for 30 years (since independence from the
[British Empire](British_Empire.md "wikilink")), under him, Malawi had been
part of [US hegemony](US_Hegemony.md "wikilink") and had repressed civil
liberties, economically stagnant and
[patriarchal](Patriarchy.md "wikilink"). Pope John Paul II visited the
country in 1989 and urged the bishops to alter the country, meeting them
later in Rome to insist again.

## Events

On the 8th of March, 1992, Malawi’s eight Catholic bishops wrote a
pastoral letter called Living in Our Faith, which was read in churches
throughout Malawi. The letter denounced the government’s rigid
censorship of mass media, infringement on education, and frequently
illegal imprisonment of hundreds of Malawians. Two days later, the
Bishops were arrested by the government, and detained and interrogated
for eight hours. Inspired by the letter, university students in Zomba
began demonstrations that spread to other areas of Malawi. Police fired
at the demonstrators and the students, who were reported to have battled
with police.

Junior army officers protected the students from the police and
encouraged them to protest. A month later, senior and middle ranking
army officials told President Banda that they would not take part in any
suppression of Malawians who wanted democracy. From the 20th to the 23rd
of March, 80 exiled opposition activists met in
[Zambia](Zambia.md "wikilink"), meeting as the United Front for Multiparty
Democracy. Following the conference, Chikufwa Chihana returned from
exile and was arrested that day after making a speech calling for
multiparty politics. Upon his arrest, pro-democracy campaigners held
more demonstrations.

Meanwhile, tapes were discovered in which government members discussed
the possibility of assassinating the bishops, which led to more
demonstrations. Throughout all this, the army firmly continued to remain
neutral. When President Banda asked for foreign aid from the
Consultative Group of the [World Bank](World_Bank.md "wikilink"), who were
meeting in [Paris](France.md "wikilink") on the 11th of May, his request
for \$800 million was denied. The aid donors told Banda that aid would
remain suspended until the human rights and political conditions in his
country changed. In the meantime, the donors only sent humanitarian aid.
Due to pressure from aid donors, Banda had already released 88 political
prisoners.

### Strike and Massacre

On the 4th of May, 3000 textile factory workers went on
[strike](strike.md "wikilink") demanding democracy and release of political
prisoners. The strike was disbanded that same day, but the workers
returned on the 6th of May to march to the city center. They were joined
by [unemployed](Unemployment.md "wikilink") youth, students, and other
workers. Police fired with live ammunition at the protestors, which lead
to looting of shops, destruction of property, and vandalism. 38 people
died during the events.

Unrest continued over the following months, with Banda supporters and
police attacking protesting students and workers. But on the 18th of
October, 1992, Banda announced a referendum to democratise the country.
People voted yes and in 1994 Malawi became a [representative
democracy](Representative_Democracy.md "wikilink").

## Results

The movement succeeded in overthrowing the dictatorship and creating a
representative democracy, but despite this, Malawi is still deeply poor
and conservative, with the government criminalising homosexuality in
2010.
