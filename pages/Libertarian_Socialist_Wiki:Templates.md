There are many **templates** in use in ; these are only a subset,
representing some of the most important and commonly used ones. If you
feel that a template belongs on this page, do not hesitate to add it.

- [:Category:Templates](:Category:Templates.md "wikilink") should cover all
  templates in the wiki.
- The Template namespace (found from
  [Special:AllPages](Special:AllPages.md "wikilink")) always has all
  templates in the wiki, sorted alphanumerically.

## What are templates?

Wiki templates provide a means to insert the same content over and over
in different (or the same) pages. This saves editors the hassle of
duplicating the same text again and again, and also helps ensure
consistency.

Templates are generally shown with the format required to use the
template (e.g. ). Clicking the template name takes you to the template's
page, where you can see what it looks like and how it is used.

**Detailed instructions on the usage of each template should exist on:**

1.  **a subpage using **; or
2.  the template page itself (inside "noinclude" tags); or
3.  the template's talk page.

For more information on templates, see
[Help:Templates](Help:Templates.md "wikilink").

## Article management templates

### Nominate an article for deletion

- Add this to an article to nominate it for deletion. It will add the
  article to [:Category:Candidates for
  deletion](:Category:Candidates_for_deletion.md "wikilink").

### Disambiguation articles

- If you have several articles that have similar or identical names, you
  may wish to create a "disambiguation" page at the main article name,
  with the articles taking an extra phrase in brackets afterwards. For
  example:


**The Prince** \<-- disambiguation page, with links to:


The Prince (frog)

The Prince (human)

- Using marks an article as a disambiguation page by adding a banner to
  the article and categorizing it under
  [:Category:Disambiguations](:Category:Disambiguations.md "wikilink"). Add
  links to the various articles under the banner.
- For more information, see
  [Help:Disambiguation](Help:Disambiguation.md "wikilink").

## General wiki templates

  the templates) without using the template itself. It is used
  extensively on this page.

  possible.
