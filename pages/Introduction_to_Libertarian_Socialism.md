[Libertarian Socialism](Libertarian_Socialism "wikilink") is a political
philosophy (a fancy way of saying 'plan to run society') that is the
main focus of this wiki. It first emerged in 19th century Europe as
split from the [socialist](Socialism "wikilink") movement arguing that
the [usual socialist comfort with
authoritarianism](Authoritarian_Socialism "wikilink") would lead to
disastrous results. Libertarian socialists began to argue that a
decentralised and democratic system of self-governing communities was
the best way to rid the world of capitalisms problems like pollution,
poverty and alienation.

## Main Principles of Libertarian Socialism

- Allowing people to control institutions relevant to them (ie their
  neighbourhood, [school](Democratic_Education "wikilink") or
  [workplace](Workers'_Self-Management "wikilink")) via [democratic
  assemblies](Democratic_Assembly "wikilink") and
  [confederations](Confederation "wikilink").
- Focus on [restorative](Restorative_Justice "wikilink") and
  [transformative justice](Transformative_Justice "wikilink").
- Creation of a culture emphasizing individuality, happiness,
  cooperation and social justice.

## History

*Main Article: [History of Libertarian
Socialism](History_of_Libertarian_Socialism "wikilink")*

It's been argued that libertarian socialism was the method of managing
numerous ancient civilisations and emerged as a movement in early
[Christianity](Christianity "wikilink") (and the many heretics of the
middle ages) [guilds](guilds "wikilink"), [maroon
communities](Maroons "wikilink"), [cooperatives](Cooperative "wikilink")
and rebellious towns. But it became a self-aware, global philosophy in
the 1800s, beginning in Western Europe and influencing [several
historical
revolutions](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Revolutions "wikilink") and
becoming a guide to [several new
societies](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Societies "wikilink") and new
[organisations](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Organizations "wikilink").

## FAQ

- **Isn't libertarian socialism an oxymoron?**

No. First of all, we have to define both terms.

In 1900s USA, the word Libertarian was stolen from anarchists (Anarchism
is left.) and used by advocates of little to no government in a
capitalist system. Libertarian Socialists are opposed to this because
there is still capitalism, and having every aspect of society controlled
by the class that only wants profit could very easily go wrong. But
generally, Libertarianism means freedom in some way or another. Freedom
from what exactly? Usually the state. We believe in freedom from the
state, but also freedom from capitalist society and all the evil that
comes from it.

Socialism is a term used for many things, most are horrible
misrepresentations of the true beliefs of socialists. But generally,
socialists can agree that the whole point of socialism is to give
control of the economy to the society. In other words, social ownership.
Now, this social ownership can come in many forms. Namely, worker,
citizen, council, union, cooperative, or some other form I forgot about.
But the point is, everyone owns the means of production together in some
way. Socialism is an ideology of liberation, cooperation, and democracy.
Anyone who says otherwise is either uneducated or a liar.

Libertarian Socialists would like to combine these two terms. We want to
make a society in which there is neither a state nor a capitalist to
oppress you. Now you may be asking why either thing is bad? But that is
a whole other question, and hopefully someone else will answer it,
because I'm a lazy socialist and want to go eat my fruity pebbles.
