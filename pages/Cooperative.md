A **cooperative** (also known as **co-operative**, **co-op**, or
**coop**) is defined by the
[ICA](International_Co-operative_Alliance.md "wikilink") "an autonomous
association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic,
social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and
democratically-controlled enterprise"[^1] and are a subject of great
interest to [libertarian socialists](Libertarian_Socialism.md "wikilink").
They are an excellent way to provide high paying jobs, low-cost housing
and low-cost consumer goods to people under a
[capitalist](Capitalism.md "wikilink") economy while also showing people
the viability of a socialist economy.

## Types of Cooperatives

### Worker Cooperative

A [worker cooperative](Worker_Cooperative.md "wikilink") is a business
which employs [self-management in the
workplace](Workers'_Self-Management.md "wikilink") to produce goods or
provide services. Workers own the business and are paid either equally
based on the workplaces profits and management of the business is either
done in [workers' assemblies](Democratic_Assembly.md "wikilink") or via
elected managers.

### Housing Cooperative

A [housing cooperative](Housing_Cooperative.md "wikilink") is a cooperative
that owns real estate and/or buildings, thus allowing tenants to manage
a large building without the existence of a
[landlord](landlord.md "wikilink") (thus reducing rents and increasing the
quality of housing).

### Consumer Cooperative

A [consumer cooperative](Consumer_Cooperative.md "wikilink") is a
cooperative that provides people with access to consumer goods and
services like electricity, water, clothing, food, tools and machinery.

### Financial Cooperative

A [financial cooperative](Financial_Cooperative.md "wikilink") is a
cooperative that provides insurance, low-interest loans, savings and
other financial services to people.
