**Prussian Education** or **Forced Schooling** refers to an ideal of
[education](education "wikilink") that stands in stark contrast to
democratic education. Prussian Education developed out of what is now
[Germany](Germany "wikilink") in the late 18th century and argues that
students should be subject to a strict timetable, curriculum and
lecture-style classrooms. Students are subjected to constant monitoring
and their progress is logged mathematically and 'graded', doling out
rewards to students.

The strongest critics of Prussian Education argue that it constitutes
indoctrination towards the worship of authority figures and often
engages in historical whitewashing (or denialism) to make the
[state](State_(Polity) "wikilink") look better. Others acknowledge these
criticisms as valid, but recognise the role these schools have in
preventing children being forced into harsh working conditions and
occasionally helping against poverty.

## History

*Note: Libertarian Socialist historians tend to develop an understanding
of Prussian Education from a critical perspective. This conflicts with
mainstream history and is possibly wrong, if sources are incorrect,
please edit.*

## Flaws

### Inefficiency

Compared to [democratic education](Democratic_Education "wikilink"),
prussian education also has inferior outcomes in terms of student
academic achievement, student critical thinking skills and student
happiness.

### Confusing

Since students lack any kind of control over their learning and classes
are not tailored to individual student needs, schools will often be
incredibly confusing for students as they are either overwhelmed by what
they are learning and

### Apathy

Because of their lack of control over their education and frequently
being punished for attempting to take control of it (such as by reading
things not part of the course), students often do not care about what
they are learning and will often forget most of it after graduating.

### Emotional Manipulation

Schools frequently instill feelings of guilt into students.

## Purposes

### Colonialism

Forced Schooling played a strong role in wiping out indigenous cultures
in order to eliminate the ability of these cultures to [socially
reproduce](Social_Reproduction "wikilink") [reverse dominance
hierarchies](Reverse_Dominance_Hierarchy "wikilink") in order to aid the
military objectives of [colonialism](colonialism "wikilink"). This is
done by wiping out language, kinship, family ties, cultural knowledge,
history and other traditions. Examples of this include the Stolen
Generations in [Australia](Stolen_Generation_(Australia) "wikilink") and
[New Zealand](Stolen_Generation_(New_Zealand) "wikilink") as well as
Residential Schools in the [USA](Residential_Schools_(USA) "wikilink"),
Mexico and [Canada](Residential_Schools_(Canada) "wikilink"). In
addition to the rampant verbal, emotional, physical and sexual abuse
that occurred in these institutions. Many psychologists believe the
forced assimilation of native cultures has contributed to their high
suicide rates and poverty.[^1]

### Statism

According to [Peter Gelderloos](Peter_Gelderloos "wikilink"):

> [Anticapitalists](Anti-Capitalism "wikilink") will often insist that
> the purpose of public education is to prepare workers. This is
> balderdash, a perfect example of dogma obviating reality. The vast
> majority of the lesson plan, once a pupil is literate and knows the
> most basic maths, is irrelevant to the tasks of the future worker,
> unless we count the abilities to follow orders, accept confinement,
> and complete meaningless tasks; however, those skills are required of
> all citizens, employed or unemployed, prole or petty-bourgeoisie. A
> typical worker has absolutely no need to know about ancient Egypt,
> William Shakespeare, or basic chemistry. No, the fundamental purpose
> of education is to civilize children, and a large part of this means
> filling their heads with the lies that are necessary to make them
> always view history and society from the perspective that privileges
> state power.[^2]
