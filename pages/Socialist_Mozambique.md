The **People's Republic of Mozambique**Â was a
[Marxist-Leninist](Marxist-Leninism "wikilink") state that existed in
[Mozambique](Mozambique "wikilink") from 1975 to 1990.

## Positives

- The army had no formal hierarchy and was based on a system of elected
  commanders, making it a [democratic
  military](Democratic_Military "wikilink").
- Corruption was apparently fairly rare and abuses of power (including
  war crimes) were harshly punished.
- It was one of the few Marxist-Leninist governments to openly promote
  [workers' self-management](Workers'_Self-Management "wikilink").

## Negatives

- The government restricted freedom of the press.
