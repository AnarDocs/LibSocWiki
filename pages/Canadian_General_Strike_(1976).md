[Canada](Canada "wikilink") in

## Events

In 1975, a new law was passed introducing wage controls across Canada
which took a year to take effect. Soon, unionised workers began to
organise resistance. On the 14th of October, a million people across
Canada refused to strike, and the wage controls were quickly reversed.
