The **Canadian General strike of 1976** was a [general
strike](List_of_General_Strikes.md "wikilink") against wage controls in
[Canada](Canada.md "wikilink") in
[1976](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_North_America.md "wikilink").

## Events

In 1975, a new law was passed introducing wage controls across Canada
which took a year to take effect. Soon, unionised workers began to
organise resistance. On the 14th of October, a million people across
Canada refused to strike, and the wage controls were quickly reversed.
