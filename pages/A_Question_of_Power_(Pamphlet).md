**A Question of Power** is a 1969
[leaflet](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Pamphlets.md "wikilink") written by
[Chris Pallis](Chris_Pallis.md "wikilink") and published by
[Solidarity](Solidarity_(UK).md "wikilink"). It is a short critique of the
authoritarian nature of [capitalism](capitalism.md "wikilink"), the failure
of [trade unions](Trade_Union.md "wikilink") and a call to working class
actions.

## Transcript

*Few of us run our own lives*. This is because we have no control over
the main decisions that affect us. These decisions are made by small
self-perpetuating minorities. This situation cannot be "democratically"
changed. What our rulers call "democracy" is a system which operates for
their own protection. As long as their "democracy" is not seriously
challenged, their dominating position in society is secure.

*Their threatened use of violence* is intended to frustrate any
challenge. It is implicit in the large [police](police.md "wikilink")
force, the courts, and the [armed forces](Military.md "wikilink") which
they control. The limited freedom that their "democracy" allows us is
further restricted or curtailed altogether whenever they think their
power is seriously threatened.

*They hold the power to maintain their power*. This is key to their
security. They determine the [kind of education
provided](Prussian_Education.md "wikilink"), and the ways and means of
providing it. By controlling what and how people are taught, those who
rule us seek to preserve the structure of existing society. Children are
educated first through the family - i.e. through the already-conditioned
parents. Then the education factories (schools and
[universities](University.md "wikilink")) take over. Their aim is to
produce people conditioned to fit into this rat-race society.

*Workers created trade unions and political parties to change all this*.
But gradually adopting similar patterns of organization to those of
their oppressors, and by concentrating the struggle almost solely on
improving working conditions and living standards, the original
revolutionary intentions have been bypassed. Working people have gained
considerable material advantages but they have lost control of their own
organizations. Today the hierarchies are in control. They can neither be
removed nor brought back to the initial aim of freeing people.

*Those who dominate production dominate society*. So long as they have
their kind of industrial stability, control will remain in their hands.
This control enables them to continue deciding what is to be produced,
who is to produce it, where, when how, and in what quantities. All this
conflicts with the interests of the real producers - the workers. Those
who run our lives continually seek ways of blurring the conflict and of
manipulating workers into accepting that management alone is capable of
making these decisions.

*The union hierarchy* assists them in this fraud. While acting as
middlemen in the labour market, the union bosses do all they can to
frustrate any awareness in [workers of their own ability to run
industry](Workers'_Self-Management.md "wikilink"). In fact, so-called
working class organizations are today an essential part of the set up.
The formation of new unions or parties would not solve the problem. In
today's conditions, they would suffer the same fate as the old ones.

*But the system is contested*. There is a constant struggle in which the
objective is self-management. In a large majority of disputes, workers
have taken real democratic decisions to act without the consent of the
union bureaucrats (so-called [unofficial
strikes](Wildcat_Strike.md "wikilink")). This is one of the signs that our
rulers' "industrial stability" is under strain. The strain is also
visible in the education factories, where students are increasingly
demanding the right to take decisions on fundamental issues. There are
many other signs of the crisis that is affecting every aspect of this
society.

*Solidarity* participates in the struggle wherever possible. We try to
expose the true situation. We seek to strengthen the confidence of
working people in their *own* ability to manage their *own* lives - at
work and outside of it. People's reliance on others to do things for
them has led to defeat after defeat. It is time for victories! Victories
depend on people consciously taking action themselves. To help in the
development of this consciousness is the only reason for the existence
of *Solidarity*.
