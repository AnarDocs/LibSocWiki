**Sven Olof Joachim Palme was a far-left communist authoritarian
socialist who ruined the swedish economy**Early Life öl

Born into an upper class, conservative Lutheran family of Dutch,
Russian, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish ancestry. He received education
from private tutors and learned German and English, entering university
at age 17 and serving in the Swedish army from 1945 to 1947. He studied
at Kenyon College, Ohio, [USA](United_States_of_America.md "wikilink") on a
scholarship, writing an essay on [Hayek's](Friedrich_Hayek.md "wikilink")
*[The Road to Serfdom](The_Road_to_Serfdom.md "wikilink")* and a senior
honour thesis on the [United Auto Workers
Union](United_Auto_Workers_Union.md "wikilink"), led at the time by [Walter
Reuther](Walter_Reuther.md "wikilink").

After graduation he traveled throughout the world, he attributes his
left-wing beliefs to three experiences:

- In 1947, he attended a debate on taxes between the Social Democrat
  [Ernst Wigforss](Ernst_Wigforss.md "wikilink"), the conservative [Jarl
  Hjalmarson](Jarl_Hjalmarson.md "wikilink") and the liberal [Elon
  Andersson](Elon_Andersson.md "wikilink")
- The time he spent in the United States in the 1940s made him realise
  how wide the [class divide](Economic_Inequality.md "wikilink") was in
  America, and the extent of [racism](racism.md "wikilink") against black
  people
- A trip to Asia, specifically [India](India.md "wikilink"), [Sri
  Lanka](Sri_Lanka.md "wikilink"), [Myanmar](Myanmar.md "wikilink"),
  [Thailand](Thailand.md "wikilink"), [Singapore](Singapore.md "wikilink"),
  [Indonesia](Indonesia.md "wikilink") and [Japan](Japan.md "wikilink") in
  1953 had opened his eyes to the consequences of colonialism and
  imperialism

He began to work in student unions, for the government and the workers
educational assocaition. He was elected to represented Jönköping County
in Swedish parliament in 1957 and he became Minister of Transport and
Communications in 1965 and aimed to promote radio and television and
protect them from [privatisation](privatisation.md "wikilink"). In 1967 he
became Minister of Education and visited the occupation of the Student
Union Building in Stockholm to speak to protesting students. In 1969, he
was elected to be the new prime minister.

## Politics

### Good Things he did

- Change the constitution to give parliament greater power than Sweden's
  monarchy, turning the monarchy into a purely ceremonial institution
- Increased job security for Swedish workers
- Creation of a large welfare state to help the disabled, immigrants,
  the poor, single-parents and the elderly.
- Expansion of [healthcare](healthcare.md "wikilink") to include dental
  care
- Expansion of education at all levels, introduction of free university
- Introduction of
  [co-determination](Co-determination_(Economics).md "wikilink") and
  profit-sharing laws in industry
- Introducing [nuclear power](Nuclear_Energy.md "wikilink") to Sweden
- Introduction of union-approved workplace safety laws
- Increased funding for childcare
- He was an outspoken feminist
- He condemned both the US (for the Vietnam War) and the USSR (for the
  crushing of the Prague Spring)
- Criticising authoritarian governments such as [Franco's
  Spain](Francoist_Spain.md "wikilink"), [Pinochet's
  Chile](Pinochet_Dictatorship.md "wikilink"),
  [Czechoslovakia](Czechoslovakia.md "wikilink") and
  [Apartheid](Apartheid_(South_Africa).md "wikilink")
- Supporting left-wing groups like the [African National
  Congress](African_National_Congress.md "wikilink"), [Palestine Liberation
  Organisation](Palestine_Liberation_Organisation.md "wikilink"),
  [Sandinistas](Sandinistas.md "wikilink"), the [Farabundo Martí National
  Liberation
  Front](Farabundo_Martí_National_Liberation_Front.md "wikilink") and
  [Fidel Castro's](Fidel_Castro.md "wikilink") revolutionaries in
  [Cuba](Cuba.md "wikilink").
- Trying to end the [Iran–Iraq War](Iran–Iraq_War.md "wikilink") by acting
  as a mediator.
- Before Christmas of 1972, he spoke on Swedish National Radio, where he
  compared the ongoing US bombings of Hanoi to historical atrocities,
  namely the bombing of Guernica, the massacres of Oradour-sur-Glane,
  Babi Yar, Katyn, Lidice and Sharpeville, and the extermination of Jews
  and other groups at Treblinka. The US government called the comparison
  a "gross insult" and decided to freeze its diplomatic relations with
  Sweden (this time the freeze lasted for over a year).

### Bad Things he did

- Raise taxes from being fairly low even by European standards to the
  highest levels in the Western world.
- Eliminating taxes on capital gains
- Occasional welfare cuts
- Secretly allying with [NATO](NATO.md "wikilink") and depending on US

## Death

Palme was shot while walking home from a cinema with his wife in
Stockholm in 1986. His killed has never been identified leading to
numerous theories about the assassination have spawned in the years
following. Although it is entirely possible that one, multiple or none
of these theories are true, it is a conclusion you will have to reach
yourself.

### Theory \#1: Arms Trafficking

It's been argued that his assassination may have been connected to the
Bofors scandal, given Palme's secret efforts to secure armanents
production contracts to sell to the [Indian](India.md "wikilink") military.
The theory suggests he was assassinated in order to stop him learning
about several corrupt elements of the deal and Swedish police hid
evidence from [MI6](MI6.md "wikilink").[^1]

### Theory \#2: CIA Involvement

According to Richard Brenneke, a man who claims to be a former
[CIA](CIA.md "wikilink") agent, the CIA was behind the assassination. This
theory supports the South African Police theory, given the close
co-operation between the US and South African government in interfering
in the affairs of other states throughout the late 20th century.
[CIA-connected fascists in Italy](Operation_Gladio#Italy.md "wikilink")
wrote telegrams saying "the Swedish tree will be felled" before his
assassination.[^2]

### Theory \#3: Organised Crime

### Theory \#4: Iran

### Theory \#5: KGB Involvement

It has been suspected that the KGB (the intelligence arm of the
[USSR](USSR.md "wikilink")) were behind the assassination, although they
possessed a motive (Palme apparently did not follow orders from the
USSR) no people associated with the KGB have ever been connected with
the case.[^3]

### Theory \#6: LaRouche Movement

At the time, Victor Gunnarsson, a member of the European Workers Party,
the Swedish branch of the [LaRouche
Movement](LaRouche_Movement.md "wikilink"), was arrested after he matched
the description and had pamphlets hostile to Palme in his home. However,
he was acquitted and eventually murdered in the
[USA](United_States_of_America.md "wikilink") as part of a love
triangle.[^4]

### Theory \#7: Mistaken for a Drug Dealer

Christer Pettersson, a local thief, drug addict and alcoholic was
strongly suspected in the case (originally arrested) he allegedly shot
him because he mistook Palme for a drug dealer.[^5]

### Theory \#8: Neo-Fascists

### Theory \#9: PKK Involvement

Both the Swedish police and Turkish governments have alleged the
assassination to be a product of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK),
although evidence for this is lacking.[^6]

### Theory \#10: Skandia Man

### Theory \#11: South African Police

Some have suspected that the South African Police were behind the
assassination, owing to Palme's outspoken criticism of
[Apartheid](Apartheid_(South_Africa).md "wikilink") and public support
(both diplomatic and financial) for the
[ANC](African_National_Conference.md "wikilink") during his government.
Supporters of this theory include several former South African police,
mercenaries and documentary makers.[^7]

### Theory \#12: Rogue Swedish Police

### Theory \#13: Yugoslavia

In January 2011 the German magazine *Focus* cited official
[German](Germany.md "wikilink") interrogation records in connection with
another investigation from 2008 as showing that the assassination had
been carried out by an operative of the
[Yugoslavian](Socialist_Yugoslavia.md "wikilink") security service. The
assassin is allegedly a 65 year old Croatian man in Zagreb who works for
private security.[^8]

Sadly, his protégé and political ally, [Bernt
Carlsson](Bernt_Carlsson.md "wikilink"), who was appointed UN Commissioner
for Namibia in July 1987, was killed in the bombing of [Pan Am Flight
103](Pan_Am_Flight_103.md "wikilink") over Lockerbie, Scotland on 21
December 1988 *en route* to the UN signing ceremony of the New York
Accords the following day.
