**Criticism of Israel**is a wide and contentious subject. We hope to
cover as many bases as possible and provide a valid distinction between
valid and invalid criticism of [Israel](Israel.md "wikilink").

## Valid Criticism of Israel

### Arms Trade

From 2015 to 2019, Israel was the 8th largest exporter of weapons in the
world, producing 3% of all weapons in the world, and the industry had
almost doubled, growing by 77% in that time.[^1] In 2014, Israel was the
greatest exporter of weapons per capita in the world, making \$97 from
the weapons industry per person.[^2]

### Assassinations and Kidnappings

Kidnappings](List_of_Israeli_Assassinations_and_Kidnappings.md "wikilink")*

Israeli Intelligence Agencies have been confirmed to have committed
multiple assassinations and kidnappings of people in other countries,
notably Syria, France and Lebanon. It is worth noting many of these
people are escaped Nazis, such as Adolf Eichmann, or members of
[Al-Qaeda](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/13/world/middleeast/al-masri-abdullah-qaeda-dead.html),
both of which are groups which should be defeated.

### Nuclear Weapons

Israel is believed to conceal its production and storage of [nuclear
weapons](Nuclear_Weapons.md "wikilink"). The most notable controversy
around this is the [Vela Incident](Vela_Incident_(1979).md "wikilink").
