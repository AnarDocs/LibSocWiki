### Propaganda Model

Noam Chomsky and [Edward Herman](Edward_Herman.md "wikilink") analyzed
western [media](media.md "wikilink") output throughout the 1980s and came
to the conclusion that five main factors were behind media biases
towards a pro-corporate, pro-state outlook on the world.

1.  The expensive and increasing cost of producing media ensures that
    only wealthy organizations will be able to afford it. Hence media
    will not be critical of wealthy organizations as an institution.
2.  Media production costs more than consumers will pay, so advertisers
    pay for the costs, ensuring media will remain uncritical of
    advertising as an institution, the specific companies behind the
    advertising will not be criticized and what the media will broadcast
    will not make people too pessimistic.
3.  Media cannot afford to place reporters everywhere, and therefore
    will put them in contact with places where the most interesting news
    comes from (ie corporate or government offices) and
4.  Business organizations regularly form 'flak machines' to spread
    confusion or mistrust in sources which actively criticise certain
    things.
5.  In order to maximize attention from viewers, media will often
    exaggerate stories and create an atmosphere of fear. This plays in
    with point 3, where enemies of the state - good or bad - will be
    portrayed as inhuman monsters.

These five filters play together to ensure people have faith in the
government and corporations, or at least cannot conceive of an
alternative to them.ist.
