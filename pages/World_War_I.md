**World War I** (often abbreviated as **WWI** or **WW1**), also known as
the **First World War** or the **Great War**, was a global war
originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918.
Contemporaneously described as "the war to end all wars", it led to the
mobilisation of more than 70Â million military personnel, including 60
million Europeans, making it one of the largest wars in history. It is
also one of the deadliest conflicts in history, with an estimated nine
million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result
of the war, while resulting genocides and the 1918 influenza pandemic
caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide. The events of World
War I led to [World War II](World_War_II "wikilink").

## Events

### End

World War I largely ended due to fears of socialist revolution,
revolutionaries had already toppled the imperial monarchies of
[Russia](February_Revolution_(Russia) "wikilink") and
[Germany](German_Revolution_(1918) "wikilink"), mutinies had crippled
the French Army in 1917 and unrest was growing across the USA. Despite
neither side having a clear victory, the war was declared to be a
victory for the entente, and the Treaty of Versailles disbanded the
Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empires, and severely limited the ability
of Germany to function as a state.
