## Transcript

This section discusses what anarchists get up to. There is little point
thinking about the world unless you also want to change it for the
better. And by trying to change it, you change yourself and others,
making radical change more of a possibility. Therefore anarchists give
their wholehearted support to attempts by ordinary people to improve
their lives by their own actions. As [Max
Stirner](Max_Stirner.md "wikilink") pointed out,“\[t\]he true man does not
lie in the future, an object of longing, but lies, existent and real, in
the present.” [The Ego and Its
Own]([The_Ego_and_Its_Own_(Book).md "wikilink"), p. 327\]For anarchists,
the future is already appearing in the present and is expressed by the
autonomy of [working class](Working_Class.md "wikilink") self-activity.
Anarchy is not some-day-to-be-achieved utopia, it is a living reality
whose growth only needs to be freed from constraint.

As such anarchist activity is about discovering and aiding emerging
trends of [mutual aid](Mutual_Aid.md "wikilink") which work against
[capitalist](Capitalism.md "wikilink") domination (i.e. what is actually
developing), so the Anarchist “studies society and tries to discover its
tendencies, past and present, its growing needs, intellectual and
economic, and in his \[or her\] ideal he merely points out in which
direction evolution goes.” [\[Peter
Kropotkin]([Peter_Kropotkin.md "wikilink"), [Kropotkin’s Revolutionary
Pamphlets](Kropotkin’s_Revolutionary_Pamphlets.md "wikilink"), p. 47\] The
kinds of activity outlined in this section are a general overview of
anarchist work. It is by no means exclusive as we are sure to have left
something out. However, the key aspect of real anarchist activity is
direct action — self-activity, self-help, self-liberation and
solidarity. Such activity may be done by individuals (for example,
propaganda work), but usually anarchists emphasis collective activity.
This is because most of our problems are of a social nature, meaning
that their solutions can only be worked on collectively.

Individual solutions to social problems are doomed to failure (for
example [green consumerism](Green_Consumerism.md "wikilink")). In addition,
collective action gets us used to working together, promoting the
experience of self-management and building organisations that will allow
us to activity manage our own affairs. Also, and we would like to
emphasis this, it’s fun to get together with other people and work with
them, it’s fulfilling and empowering. Anarchists do not ask those in
power to give up that power. No, they promote forms of activity and
organisation by which all the oppressed can liberate themselves by their
own hands. In other words, we do not think that those in power will
altruistically give up that power or their privileges.

Instead, the oppressed must take the power back into their own hands by
their own actions. We must free ourselves, no one else can do it for
use. As we have noted before, anarchism is more than just a critique of
[statism](State_(Polity).md "wikilink") and capitalism or a vision of a
freer, better way of life. It is first and foremost a movement, the
movement of working class people attempting to change the world.
Therefore the kind of activity we discuss in this section of the FAQ
forms the bridge between capitalism and anarchy. By self-activity and
direct action, people can change both themselves and their surroundings.
They develop within themselves the mental, ethical and spiritual
qualities which can make an anarchist society a viable option.

As [Noam Chomsky](Noam_Chomsky.md "wikilink") argues: “Only through their
own struggle for liberation will ordinary people come to comprehend
their true nature, suppressed and distorted within institutional
structures designed to assure obedience and subordination. Only in this
way will people develop more humane ethical standards, ‘a new sense of
right’, ‘the consciousness of their strength and their importance as a
social factor in the life of their time’ and their capacity to realise
the strivings of their ‘inmost nature.’ Such direct engagement in the
work of social reconstruction is a prerequisite for coming to perceive
this ‘inmost nature’ and is the indispensable foundations upon which it
can flourish” \[preface to [Rudolf Rocker’s](Rudolf_Rocker.md "wikilink")
[Anarcho-Syndicalism](Anarcho-Syndicalism:_Theory_and_Practice.md "wikilink"),
p. viii\]

In other words, anarchism is not primarily a vision of a better future,
but the actual social movement which is fighting within the current
unjust and unfree society for that better future and to improve things
in the here and now. Without standing up for yourself and what you
believe is right, nothing will change. Therefore anarchists would agree
wholeheartedly with [Frederick Douglass](Frederick_Douglass.md "wikilink")
(an [Abolitionist](Abolitionism_(USA).md "wikilink")) who stated that: “If
there is no struggle, there is no progress. Those who profess to favor
freedom and yet deprecate agitation are people who want crops without
plowing up the ground. They want rain without thunder and lightning.
That struggle might be a moral one; it might be a physical one; it might
be both moral and physical, but it must be a struggle. Power concedes
nothing without a demand. It never did and never will. People might not
get all that they work for in this world, but they must certainly work
for all they get.”

In this section of the FAQ we will discuss anarchist ideas on struggle,
what anarchists actually (and, almost as importantly, do not) do in the
here and now and the sort of alternatives anarchists try to build within
statism and capitalism in order to destroy them. As well as a struggle
against oppression, anarchist activity is also struggle for freedom. As
well as fighting against material poverty, anarchists combat spiritual
poverty. By resisting hierarchy we emphasis the importance of living and
of life as art. By proclaiming “Neither Master nor Slave” we urge an
ethical transformation, a transformation that will help create the
possibility of a truly free society.

This point was argued by [Emma Goldman](Emma_Goldman.md "wikilink") after
she saw the defeat of the [Russian
Revolution](Russian_Revolution_(1917).md "wikilink") by a combination of
[Leninist](Marxist-Leninism.md "wikilink") politics and [capitalist armed
intervention](Allied_Intervention_in_the_Russian_Civil_War.md "wikilink"):
“the ethical values which the revolution is to establish must be
initiated with the revolutionary activities... The latter can only serve
as a real and dependable bridge to the better life if built of the same
material as the life to be achieved.” [Red Emma
Speaks]([Red_Emma_Speaks_(Book).md "wikilink"), p. 358\] In other words,
anarchist activity is more than creating libertarian alternatives and
resisting hierarchy, it is about building the new world in the shell of
the old not only with regards to organisations and self-activity, but
also within the individual. It is about transforming yourself while
transforming the world — both processes obviously interacting and
supporting each other — “the first aim of Anarchism is to assert and
make the dignity of the individual human being.” [\[Charlotte
Wilson]([Charlotte_Wilson.md "wikilink"), [Three Essays on
Anarchism](Three_Essays_on_Anarchism_(Book).md "wikilink"), p. 17\]

And by direct action, self-management and self-activity we can make the
words first heard in Paris, 1968 a living reality: “All power to the
imagination!” Words, we are sure, the classic anarchists would have
wholeheartedly agreed with. There is a power in humans, a creative
power, a power to alter what is into what should be. Anarchists try to
create alternatives that will allow that power to be expressed, the
power of imagination. In the sections that follow we will discuss the
forms of self-activity and self-organisation (collective and individual)
which anarchists think will stimulate and develop the imagination of
those oppressed by hierarchy, build anarchy in action and help create a
free society.
