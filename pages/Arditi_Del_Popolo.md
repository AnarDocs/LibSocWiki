The **Arditi Del Popolo** (English: People's Daring Ones) was an
[anti-fascist](Anti-Fascism "wikilink")
[militia](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Organizations "wikilink") active
in [Italy](Kingdom_of_Italy "wikilink") to combat
[fascism](fascism "wikilink") from [1921 to
1925](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Southern_Europe "wikilink").
It was the first example of a militant anti-fascist group in history.

## History

Founded by Argo Secondari in Rome in late June 1921, it built an
alliance of anarchists, communists, socialists and republicans in the
structure of a [democratic militia](Democratic_Militia "wikilink"). In a
few months they had 144 sections with over 20,000 members, and won
several gunfights with fascist gangs.

## Downfall

The downfall and failure of the Arditi Del Popolo occurred for two main
reasons.

- The fascists received large amounts of financial and material support
  from the rich and police, the Arditi del Popolo did not recieve the
  same kind of support from anywhere.
- The [Leninist](Authoritarian_Socialism "wikilink") Communist Party of
  Italy and Italian Socialist Party withdrew support from the group for
  political purposes to try and win the [class
  war](Class_Struggle "wikilink") through parliamentary means as well as
  achieve peace with [Mussolini](Benito_Mussolini "wikilink"). Leaving
  only the [Italian Anarchist Union](Italian_Anarchist_Union "wikilink")
  and [Italian Syndicalist
  Union](Italian_Syndicalist_Union "wikilink").[^1]

## Legacy

Many former members of the Arditi Del Popolo fought in the International
Brigades in the [Spanish Civil War](Spanish_Civil_War "wikilink") and
during the [Italian Resistance](Italian_Resistance "wikilink") in [World
War II](World_War_II "wikilink").[^2]
