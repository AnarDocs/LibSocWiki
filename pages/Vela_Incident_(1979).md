The **Vela Incident of 1979** refers to an unexplained double flash of
light detected by US military satellite in the Southern Ocean in the
middle of a storm. Information about the incident is partially
classified by the US government who offer the explanation that a
micro-meteorite struck the satellite and interfered with the camera,
while others argue it was an undeclared [nuclear
test](Nuclear_Weapons "wikilink") likely carried out by
[Israel](Israel "wikilink") and [South Africa](South_Africa "wikilink").
