The **War on Drugs** is a global campaign led by the
[USA](United_States_of_America "wikilink") which has the stated purpose
of wanting to end the illegal trade and use of
[drugs](drugs "wikilink"). It began in 1971, and is largely been
regarded to be a colossal failure of policy and even
[conservatives](Conservatism "wikilink") have begun calling for its end.
However, some critics have argued that the campaign is a highly
successful cover story involved in disrupting social movements,
increasing the [rate of profit](Rate_of_Profit "wikilink") and
justifying giving more power to the [state](State_(Polity) "wikilink").
