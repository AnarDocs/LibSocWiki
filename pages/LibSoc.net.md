LibSoc.net is a new\* Social Network for people who aspire to live in a
more liberated society. (\*January 2021)

It has a facebook style format with long posts and a generic newsfeed
but doesn't suffer from independent fact checkers, and analytics outside
of the unavoidable snooping on things like videos posted by users from
youtube and such like.

The "soc" part of the name stands for "Society" with the thing being
that we would like to live in a more LIBerated SOCiety. Alot of
Americans associate socialism with national socialism which is what
early socialists described as bourgeousie socialism which was that the
society wasn't so much a society but a cattle farm pretending to be
constructed on the values of the cattle who were kepy in strict mental
and/or physical confinement. I prefer the word "Societalism" to
socialism since its easy to see why people would be offended at the
promotion of "socialism" given how it has been bastardised to mean the
very opposite of everyone having equality in fundamental rights. (IE The
rights without which, not higher rights could be acquired.)
