The **Phulbari Anti-Mine Movement** was an effort by
[environmentalists](Environmentalism.md "wikilink") and indigenous people
to stop the construction of a [coal mine](Fossil_Fuels.md "wikilink") in
[Bangladesh](Bangladesh.md "wikilink") from [2006 to
2014](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Southern_Asia.md "wikilink").

## Background

Phulbari is a region in the northwest region of Bangladesh. It is an
important agricultural region that is also home to low quality coal
deposit. Several companies have proposed to use the open pit technique
for [mining](mining.md "wikilink") the coal, which would displace thousands
of people, many of them indigenous people. The proposed mining projects
would destroy farmland, homes, and divert water sources to be used in
the mining process. The [Australia](Australia.md "wikilink")-based mining
company BHP Billiton discovered coal at Phulbari during surveying and
drilling between 1994 and 1997.

In 2005, BHP Billiton assessed Phulbari’s coal mining potential and
decided to sell its rights to mine to London-based Asia Energy
Corporation after concluding that the depth of the coal deposits would
making mining activity so destructive that it would not be feasible to
comply with Australia’s environmental standards or those of any nation
worldwide. Asia Energy Corporation bought the rights to mine and
proposed an open pit mine project in 2005. Asia Energy Corporation
estimated that the mining project would take 36 years to mine the
deposit, extracting up to 8 million tons of coal per year. The
Bangladesh Department of Environment granted the project “Environmental
Clearance for Mining” on the 11th of September 2005. In order for the
project to move ahead, the Government of Bangladesh had to officially
approve the project proposal.[^1]

## Timeline of Events

- 26/08/2006: 50,000 people marched in protest against the proposed
  mining project. The Bangladesh Rifles, a paramilitary organization,
  fired on the protesters and killed 3 people. Between one and two
  hundred other protesters were injured. One protester defiantly said:
  “We will give our lives, but we will not leave this place. We will not
  allow the mine to happen. The government can take as many dead bodies
  as they want, we won’t leave the village. And no one from Asia Energy
  will come here again. They won’t even be able to enter this area. We
  will fight.”
- 28/08/2006: Workers' in shops, offices, schools and roads launch a
  three-day long [general strike](General_Strike.md "wikilink") that shuts
  down the countries economy in protest of the mines construction. The
  strike causes Asia Energy Corporation to suspend operations in the
  country and its employees flee the country under police escort.
- 31/08/2006: The Bangladeshi government signs the August Agreement,
  which promises to ban open pit mining in Phulbari, institute peoples’
  ownership over their own resources, ensure energy security, cancel bad
  deals, ban the export of mineral resources and strengthen national
  capability to ban open-pit mining in Phulbari and exclude Asia Energy
  Corporation from the country. This stops the strike.
- ??/02/2007: Mr. Nuruzuman, a local leader of the anti-mine movement,
  is publicly tortured by the military.
- 26/08/2008: On the second anniversary of the massacre of anti-mine
  protesters, a public vigil is held. Also in August, 110
  environmentalist organizations sign a letter to companies that
  invested in the mine project to end their investments. Several banks
  comply and withdraw capital from the project.
- 10/03/2009: The Bangladeshi government claims to have lost a report by
  a government formed committee of experts that found the government's
  plan to reopen the mine illegal and that it was not economically
  viable.
- 26/08/2009: On the third anniversary of the massacre of anti-mine
  protesters, flowers are placed in public locations across Bangladesh
  to remember the fallen. Protest marches occur across the country in
  protest of the proposed reopening of the mine.
- ??/10/2010: Tens of thousands of people march for 400 kilometres over
  7 days to protest the mine.
- 28/02/2011: Two thousand people blockade a highway in Phulbari and
  demand the government honour the August agreement. The Rapid Action
  Battalion (an internationally condemned death squad for its use of
  torture and extra-judicial killings) is sent in to intimidate the
  protesters and guard offices of the coal company.
- 05/05/2011: Women and children protesting the mine are attacked by
  thugs employed by the government, publicly breaking their hands. Other
  protesters begin a two-day blockade of roads and railway lines in
  protest of this display of violence.
- 07/05/2012: Police attack and violently beat protesters calling for a
  ban on open pit mining and demanding renewable energy projects. 15 of
  the protesters were injured.
- 23/11/2012: The Bangladeshi government bans gatherings of more than
  four people indefinitely in an effort to stop the movement. This
  results in thousands rioting across the country, a strike that
  paralyzes trains, businesses and schools, attacking police and
  blocking roads. An effigy of Dan Mozena, the [United
  States](United_States_of_America.md "wikilink") Ambassador to Bangladesh,
  is burned because of his lobbying for the mine's construction.
- 01/01/2013: Protesters threaten to destroy the offices of the mining
  company if not vacated.
- 27/01/2013: The mining company sees shareholder's take out their
  capital, refuse to visit the country and many senior members resign.

## Results

On the 6th of February, 2014, the government of Bangladesh canceled the
coal project, recognising that food security and protecting the farmer's
land is in Bangladesh's best interest. Open pit mining in Phulbari has
stopped for now. Further development in the mining is being prevented by
the protesters threat of action against the project.[^2]
