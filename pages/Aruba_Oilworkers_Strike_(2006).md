The **Aruba Oilworkers Strike of 2006** was a
[strike](List_of_Strikes.md "wikilink") in
[2006](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_the_Caribbean.md "wikilink") in
Aruba, a territory of the [Netherlands](Netherlands.md "wikilink") in the
Caribbean.

## Background

In 2004, Valero, the largest independent [oil](Fossil_Fuels.md "wikilink")
refiner in the [United States](United_States_of_America.md "wikilink"),
bought a refinery plant on the coast of Aruba. The workers of the
refinery were a part of the Independent Oil Workers Union of Aruba. In
September 2006, they signed an agreement to become members of the
[United Steelworkers International
Union](United_Steelworkers_International_Union.md "wikilink"). At this
time, Jay Jeffries, the lead negotiator from the United Steel Workers,
met with Ray Buckley, vice president and general manager of the
refinery, to discuss a new contract for the refinery workers.

## Events

Although Union officials and Valero worked on a new agreement from
September on, they failed to finalize a contract. On Tuesday November
28, half of the workforce, about 385 workers, went on strike and asked
for higher pay and more benefits. Since the non-unionized workers did
not participate in the strike, the refinery maintained operation at
normal pace while some of the workers went on strike.

On the 29th of November, 15% of the workers (about 50 workers) returned
to work. Despite this partial capitulation, the strike remained strong.
Valero executives argued that union workers had no right to strike
because the company gave its workers very competitive wages and benefit
packages compared to other jobs on the island. Their previous contract
included a 47% increase in salary and benefits over their five-year
contract, as well as a 12% boost in salary and benefits the first year
of working for Valero.

Valero attempted to convince employees that their contracts were fair.
They reminded workers that they no longer had to pay three percent of
their income to their pension plan, as Valero covered those costs.
Valero also invested \$360 million to make the refinery safer, more
reliable and more [environmentally
friendly](Environmentalism.md "wikilink") for its workers. However, workers
insisted on a three to four-year contract instead of a five-year
contract, better wages, and more vacation days. Workers asked for
vacation days that were in accord with the island lifestyle, but Valero
wanted to give them the same vacation time that they gave to workers in
the United States.

## Results

The strike created a new five-year contract that included significant
wage and shift differential increases, improvements to their pension
plans, and enhancements to insurance programs.
