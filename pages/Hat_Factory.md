The **Hat Factory** was a [squat](List_of_Squats "wikilink") and [social
center](Social_Center "wikilink") that was [set up in 2001 and evicted
in 2014](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Oceania "wikilink") in
Sydney, [Australia](Australia "wikilink").

## History

The Hat Factory was established in 2001, as squatters set up a library,
a [free shop](Free_Shop "wikilink"), kitchen, [an
assembly](Democratic_Assembly "wikilink"), movie theatre and places for
people to sleep. It hosted movies, discussions, concerts, fundraisers
and dinners.[^1] After the owner desired to sell the property in a
context of rising house prices[^2] in the are, 50 riot
[police](police "wikilink") moved in, but the Hat Factory had reinforced
its doors and built up barricades. The police eventually broke in with a
battering ram and the squatters dispersed into the street.[^3] The house
was eventually sold and the squatters were heavily demonized by the
Australian media despite legal concerns being raised about the violation
of tenants rights.[^4]
