**Trade Unions** are organizations which (in theory) represent the
interests of [workers](Working_Class "wikilink") as opposed to
[bosses](Boss "wikilink").

## History

Trade unions are seen by some as the successor to the
[guilds](Guild "wikilink") of medieval Europe, although this is
disputed. Trade unions first emerged in the late 1700s in Northwest
Europe (notably Britain) with the rise of the industrial revolution and
capitalism.

With the rise of neoliberalism in the 1970s and 1980s, many states began
to place strong legal restrictions on trade unions due them peaking at
their power, leading to several violent confrontations.

## Philosophical Debates

### Industrial vs Craft Unionism

### Electoralism

## Criticism

### Co-Opation

Many leftists have argued that trade unions, being entities clearly
visible to capitalists and the state, are vulnerable to
[co-optation](co-optation "wikilink"), rendering them supports of the
system and the entities that destroy radical movements.

### Workerism

Trade unions have been accused by some as
[workerist](Workerism "wikilink"), being unable to account for people
who do not work (ie the unemployed, homemakers, children, teenagers,
students, the elderly, the disabled and prisoners, who make up around
40% of the population of most western countries).
