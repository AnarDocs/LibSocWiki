The **Nymboida Mine Work-In** was an episode of [workers'
control](Workers'_Self-Management "wikilink") in Nymboida, New South
Wales, [Australia](Commonwealth_of_Australia "wikilink") from [1975 to
1979](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Oceania "wikilink").

## Background

On the 7th of February, 1975, Nymboida Collieries announced the closure
of its small mine in northern coastal New South Wales because it was
insufficiently profitable, and issued dismissal notices to the thirty
workers, whose years of service ranged from ten to twenty-six years. The
company also intimated it would not pay the workers some \$70,000 they
were owed in severance pay, annual leave, and other entitlements. The
miners were all union members, and met and collectively agreed to
perform a work-in.[^1]

## Workers' Control

In exchange for not paying owed wages and benefits, Nymboida Collieries
agreed to hand ownership of the mine over to the workers after a few
weeks. Productivity immediately increased from 500 tons of coal a week
to 700 tons of coal a week (or a 40% increase in production!) despite no
improvements to machinery or the size of the labour force. This was due
to increased motivation, less skipping of work and a more efficiently
organized mine.[^2]

## End

Workers' Control at Nymboida Mine ended as the local power station
supplying the mine with electricity was closed down.[^3]
