**Green Bans** are [strikes](Strike.md "wikilink") designed to protect the
environment or key parts of a local community. They were mainly done in
[Australia](Australia.md "wikilink") in the
[1970s](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Oceania.md "wikilink"), led by
the [Builders Labourers
Federation](Builders_Labourers_Federation.md "wikilink") (BLF) and used to
protect parkland, low-income housing and buildings with historical
significance. The Green Bans have served as one of the main historical
inspirations for [Green Syndicalism](Green_Syndicalism.md "wikilink").

## Philosophy

[Jack Mundey](Jack_Mundey.md "wikilink"), a leading Green Ban organiser,
summarised the philosophy of the Green Bans as such:

> "Yes, we want to build. However, we prefer to build urgently-required
> hospitals, schools, other public utilities, high-quality flats, units
> and houses, provided they are designed with adequate concern for the
> environment, than to build ugly unimaginative architecturally-bankrupt
> blocks of concrete and glass offices... Though we want all our members
> employed, we will not just become robots directed by
> developer-builders who value the dollar at the expense of the
> environment. More and more, we are going to determine which buildings
> we will build... The environmental interests of three million people
> are at stake and cannot be left to developers and building employers
> whose main concern is making profit. Progressive unions, like ours,
> therefore have a very useful social role to play in the citizens'
> interest, and we intend to play it."

## Results

Green Bans saved many vital urban and green spaces and over 100
buildings were considered by the National Trust to be worthy of
preservation. The bans led to new historical buildings and environmental
legislations in the 1970s across several states and the Australian
government. They also contributed the introduction of ['Green' as a
political word](Environmentalism.md "wikilink") after inspiring [Petra
Kelly](Petra_Kelly.md "wikilink").[^1]
