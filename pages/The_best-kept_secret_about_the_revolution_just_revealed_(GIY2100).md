2100](Glimpses_into_the_Year_2100_(Book) "wikilink") by [Ilan

## The best-kept secret about the revolution just revealed

Ri got up a bit earlier than usual on the second day of the 5-day
end-of-year festival. He had an important schedule because of his
mandate as member of the district assembly of delegates. The first thing
was a meeting of the educational committee. The meeting was hosted by a
neighbouring community. During the morning, they edited the final draft
of their yearly report to the assembly of delegates. Immediately after
the midday meal they shared at the host community’s dining room, they
joined the other members of the district assembly for the accountability
meeting.

Though the draft reports of all the committees were already available on
the communication system, there was a non-redundant discussion at the
assembly as nearly all committees were proposing some points to
deliberate and to put on the agendas of the district grassroots
communities for decision. The main point raised by the educational
committee was to intensify the relations and visits of the older teens
with the various city polytechnics so the passage to higher education
would be smoother. The idea had been discussed the previous year by the
city educational committee and a few district educational committees had
accepted the challenge to be the testing ground, if approved by their
district and grassroots communities.

The decision finally arrived at was that the new approach would be
approved by the district grassroots communities, and a special programme
would be developed for the two higher age-groups of the district’s high
school. When the district assembly finally ended, they had a surprise
waiting for them: they were invited to the 80th birthday party of Gil, a
veteran of the city spokespersons at the time of the uprising that
eventually became the 2050 revolution. He was a member of one of the
grassroots communities of the district and had even participated a few
times as guest at the district committee.

However, throughout the years he participated as a welcomed non-delegate
at meetings of the city and district assemblies committees, though he
refused to be formally delegated to any of them. It was a mystery all
those years why he refused to be delegated to the district or city or
any higher-level assembly of delegates. Though he was not a delegate to
any inter-city assembly of delegates he was twice proposed as a special
delegate to the world assembly of delegates, but even then he declined
the offer. Rumour was he might use this birthday party to reveal the
reasons for his strange reluctance to be delegated. And indeed, when the
party was drawing to an end Gil called for a moment of quiet, and
started to speak:

> “You all know that before the revolution I was a member of this
> country’s specific anarchist federation for years. In the
> spokespersons’ assembly of the mass uprising of 2049, I was often
> delegated by my district collective to the spokespersons’ meetings of
> the coordination committees of various social struggle movements. The
> day when events in our city proved to be the turning point in the
> revolution has been written about in the history of the revolution.
> There was even a movie about the critical hours preceding the
> explosion of the bridge that prevented the last efforts of the State
> forces who were trying to disperse the spokespersons and suppress the
> uprising.

> The movie, and all the other texts about these crucial moments,
> vividly describe the moment when I put forward a motion calling for a
> vote whether to continue the discussions and polemics or to block the
> State forces from entering the city. Some ‘consensus people’ objected
> to any vote as long as there was strong objection from the Leninist
> left and other reformists and the chairperson, who was also the head
> of his party’s central committee, just refused to put the motion to
> order to the vote. And, of course, you all know that I and a few other
> comrades forced him out of the chair. I replaced him and put the call
> for a motion to order to the vote.

> The over-whelming majority supported it and discussions at that point
> ended. Immediately afterwards the usual two speakers in support and
> two against made their cases briefly, followed by the vote on the
> decision to block the State forces from entering the city. There was
> overwhelming support for blowing up all the bridges leading to the
> city, and this was immediately implemented. It was the point when the
> 2049 uprising turned into the full-blown 2050 revolution... But what
> you do not know, and what was never revealed, is that I did it on my
> own initiative — without any collective decision or deliberations...
> Because of this —and not as a form of self-punishment or
> guilt-cleansing, but as a precaution against any repetition of
> power-taking by me, on my own initiative — I refused, from that moment
> on, any mandate for any post involving decisions about other people —
> not even a specific mandate, if included the tiniest amount of power
> or authority.”

Making his way home after the party, Ri could see how fast these
sensational revelations were spreading over the information system —
first the district one, then the city system, quickly reaching the news
headlines of the world main language feeds. As he entered their dwelling
unit Ti, who was still up despite the late hour, excitedly shared the
sensational news with him...
