Terrorist attacks attributed to groups associated with the cause of
Palestinian Nationalism. Please note 3 things:

- Not all terrorist attacks by Palestinians are counted, this page is a
  (very-much incomplete) list of terrorist attacks specifically
  associated with Palestinian Nationalism.
- Terrorism must intentionally target civilians, attacks against
  military targets are not listed here.
- Non-Palestinians can still commit terrorist attacks and attacks can
  happen outside of Palestine and [Israel](Israel.md "wikilink").
