**The Irrational in Politics** is a 1970
[book](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Books.md "wikilink") by [Chris
Pallis](Chris_Pallis.md "wikilink") which attempts to understand why people
submit to authority even if they know it is unjust or inefficient,
arguing that it lies in [sexual
repression](Sexual_Repression.md "wikilink"). The book is often seen as an
introduction to the ideas of [Wilhelm
Reich](Wilhelm_Reich.md "wikilink").[^1]
