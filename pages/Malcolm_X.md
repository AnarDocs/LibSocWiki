**Malcolm X** was an American Sunni minister and human rights activist
who was a popular figure during the civil rights movement. He is best
known for his controversial advocacy for the rights of blacks; some
consider him a man who indicted white America in the harshest terms for
its crimes against black Americans, while others accused him of
preaching racism and violence. He has been called one of the greatest
and most influential African Americans in history.

## Assassination

Much like other civil rights leaders (notably [Martin Luther King
Jr.](Martin_Luther_King_Jr. "wikilink") and [Fred
Hampton](Fred_Hampton "wikilink")) Malcolm X was shot dead, his
assassination has spawned two notable [conspiracy
theories](Conspiracy_Theory "wikilink").

### Events

On February 21, 1965, he was preparing to address the OAAU in
Manhattan's Audubon Ballroom when someone in the 400-person audience
yelled, "Nigger! Get your hand outta my pocket!" As Malcolm X and his
bodyguards tried to quell the disturbance, a man rushed forward and shot
him once in the chest with a sawed-off shotgun and two other men charged
the stage firing semi-automatic handguns. Malcolm X was pronounced dead
at 3:30 pm, shortly after arriving at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital.
The autopsy identified 21 gunshot wounds to the chest, left shoulder,
arms and legs, including ten buckshot wounds from the initial shotgun
blast.

### Theory \#1: Nation of Islam

All evidence points to a level of involvement by the [Nation of
Islam](Nation_of_Islam "wikilink"), an black [Islamic](Islam "wikilink")
group in the [USA](United_States_of_America "wikilink") that Malcolm X
was once a member of, but he had a notable falling out with the Nation
after denouncing black nationalism and the rape culture within the
organisation. The evidence

- The three gunmen who shot him were all members of the Nation of Islam,
  confessed to their crimes and implicated other members
- Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, has implied he may
  have triggered the assassination.
- The Nation of Islam had tried to kill him several times and sent him
  threatening phone calls.
- Elijah Muhammad, the then leader of the Nation of Islam, said he got
  what was coming to him, but denied responsibility.

### Theory \#2: FBI

Some have speculated that Malcolm X was killed by the
[FBI](Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation "wikilink") and New York City
[police](police "wikilink") as part of
[COINTELPRO](COINTELPRO "wikilink"), the evidence for this includes:

- The FBI had been spying on Malcolm extensively, and police had
  infiltrated the Nation of Islam.
- Police failed to provide protection for Malcolm, allowing the
  assassins to easily enter the ballroom.
- Police failed to preserve the crime scene.
- Earl Grant, a friend of Malcolm X, said: "About five minutes later, a
  most incredible scene took place. Into the hall sauntered about a
  dozen policemen. They were strolling at a pace one would expect of
  them as if they were patrolling a quiet park. They did not seem to be
  at all excited or concerned at all with the circumstances. I could
  hardly believe my eyes. Here were New York City policemen, entering a
  room from which at least a dozen shots had been heard, and yet none of
  them had his gun out! As a matter of fact, some of them even had their
  hands in their pockets.
- John Ali, national secretary of the Nation of Islam, was believed to
  have been an FBI undercover agent
- Malcolm X had confided to a reporter that Ali exacerbated tensions
  between him and Elijah Muhammad and that he considered Ali his
  "archenemy" within the Nation of Islam leadership.
- Ali had a meeting with Talmadge Hayer, one of the men convicted of
  killing Malcolm X, the night before the assassination.
- Several US government documents around Malcolm X are still concealed,
  despite calls for their release.
