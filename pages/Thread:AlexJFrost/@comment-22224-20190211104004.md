Hello, I'm a member of FANDOM's Community Support team. We're excited to
have Libertarian Socialist Wiki as part of the FANDOM community!

It may seem like there’s a lot to do, but we’re here to help make
getting started quick and easy. Here are some helpful tips and links to
get your community going:

- Check out [Wiki Features](Special:WikiFeatures "wikilink") to turn on
  some special features including our popular community Chat.
- Customize your community’s color and style by visiting the [Theme
  Designer](Special:ThemeDesigner "wikilink").
- Stop by [Community Central](w:c:community "wikilink") to check out the
  [staff blog](w:c:community:Blog:Wikia_Staff_Blog "wikilink"), and ask
  questions on our [community
  forum](w:c:community:Special:Forum "wikilink").
- Lastly, visit our [help pages](Help:Contents "wikilink") to learn the
  ins and outs of using FANDOM, or visit [FANDOM
  University](w:c:community:Wikia_University "wikilink") for quick
  how-to videos.

Have fun!<ac_metadata title="Welcome!"> </ac_metadata>
