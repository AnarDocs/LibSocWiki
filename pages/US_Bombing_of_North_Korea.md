The **US Bombing of North Korea** refers to the extensive bombing
campaign against [North Korea](North_Korea "wikilink") from [1950 to
1953](Timeline_of_US_Hegemony "wikilink") during the [Korean
War](Korean_War "wikilink") and its catastrophic consequences for the
people of North Korea.

## The Bombings

The U.S. dropped a total of 635,000 tons of bombs, including 32,557 tons
of napalm, on Korea. By comparison, the U.S. dropped 1.6 million tons in
the European theater and 500,000 tons in the Pacific theater during all
of World War II (including 160,000 on Japan). North Korea ranks
alongside Cambodia (500,000 tons), Laos (2 million tons), and South
Vietnam (4 million tons) as among the most heavily-bombed countries in
history, with Laos suffering the most extensive bombardment relative to
its size and population.

After running low on urban targets, U.S. bombers destroyed hydroelectric
and irrigation dams in the later stages of the war, flooding farmland
and destroying crops. On 13 May 1953, 20 F-84s of the 58th Fighter
Bomber Wing attacked the Toksan Dam, producing a flood that destroyed
seven hundred buildings in Pyongyang and thousands of acres of rice. On
15-16 May, two groups of F-84s attacked the Chasan Dam. The flood from
the destruction of the Toksan dam "scooped clean" 27 miles (43 km) of
river valley. The attacks were followed by the bombing of the Kuwonga
Dam, the Namsi Dam and the Taechon Dam. The bombing of these five dams
and ensuing floods threatened several million North Koreans with
starvation; according to Charles K. Armstrong, "only emergency
assistance from China, the USSR, and other socialist countries prevented
widespread famine."

USAF General Curtis Lemay commented, "We went over there and fought the
war and eventually burned down every town in North Korea anyway, some
way or another, and some in South Korea, too." Pyongyang, which saw 75
percent of its area destroyed, was so devastated that bombing was halted
as there were no longer any worthy targets. By the end of the campaign,
US bombers had difficulty in finding targets and were reduced to bombing
footbridges or jettisoning their bombs into the sea. Public statements
by the UN command obfuscated the extent of the destruction of North
Korean communities with euphemisms, for example by listing the
destruction of thousands of individual "buildings" rather than towns or
villages as such, or reporting attacks on North Korean supply centers
located in a city with language suggesting that the entire city
constituted a "supply center."

## Effects

- The war's highest-ranking U.S. POW, U.S. Major General William F.
  Dean, reported that the majority of North Korean cities and villages
  he saw were either rubble or snow-covered wasteland.
- In May 1951, an international fact-finding team from [East
  Germany](East_Germany "wikilink"), [West
  Germany](West_Germany "wikilink"), [China](China "wikilink") and the
  [Netherlands](Netherlands "wikilink") stated, "The members, in the
  whole course of their journey, did not see one town that had not been
  destroyed, and there were very few undamaged villages."
- In June 1951, General O'Donnell, commander of the Far Eastern Air
  Force Bomber Command, testified to the US Senate that "almost the
  entire Korean Peninsula is just a terrible mess. Everything is
  destroyed. There is nothing standing worth of the name ... Just before
  the Chinese came in we were grounded. There were no more targets in
  Korea".
- In August 1951, war correspondent Tibor Meráy said he witnesseed "a
  complete devastation between the Yalu River and the capital" and that
  there were "no more cities in North Korea." He added, "My impression
  was that I am travelling on the moon because there was only
  devastation - every city was a collection of Chimneys."
- The bombings led to people embracing the rule of North Korea's
  government. To quote Charles K. Armstrong, a historian on the Korean
  War "For the North Koreans, living in fear of B-29 attacks for nearly
  three years, including the possibility of atomic bombs, the American
  air war left a deep and lasting impression. The DPRK government never
  got for the lesson of North Korea's vulnerability to American air
  attack, and for half a century after the Armistice continue to
  strengthen anti-aircraft defenses, build underground installations,
  and eventually develop nuclear weapons to ensure that North Korea
  would not find itself in such a visitation again .. The war against
  the United States, more than any other single factor, gave North
  Koreans a collective sense of anxiety and fear of outside threats that
  would continue long after the war's end.
