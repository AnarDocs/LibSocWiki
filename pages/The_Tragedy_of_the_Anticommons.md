The **Tragedy of the Anticommons**or**The Tragedy of Private Property**
is a type of [coordination
breakdown](Coordination_Breakdown.md "wikilink"), in which a single
resource has numerous [private owners](Private_Property.md "wikilink") who
prevent others from using it, frustrating what would be a [socially
desirable outcome](Pareto_Optimality.md "wikilink"). It is a mirror-image
of the older concept of [tragedy of the
commons](Tragedy_of_the_Commons.md "wikilink"), in which [commons-based
arrangement](Commons.md "wikilink") leads to resource depletion as no one
person feels responsible for its maintenance.
