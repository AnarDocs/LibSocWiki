**African Socialism** refers to a political philosophy that existed
throughout the second half of the 20th century across
[Africa](Africa "wikilink"). Common features of African Socialism
include:

- Economic development guided by the state
- A strong, pan-African identity and the condemnation of colonialism
- Centered around a strongman
- Low levels of civil liberties

African Socialism was practiced by 21 states (out of 52 states) or 40%
of the continent. Although starting with good intentions, it largely
failed due to the combined influence of the
[US](Timeline_of_US_Imperialism "wikilink") and
[USSR](Timeline_of_USSR_Imperialism "wikilink") in their efforts to
manipulate Africa in the [Cold War](Cold_War "wikilink"). Most African
Socialist States failed economically and were wiped out by revolutions,
civil wars, coups and foreign manipulation. 62% of African Socialist
States collapsed during the [Revolutions of 1986 -
1995](Revolutions_of_1986_-_1995 "wikilink").

Sankara](Thomas_Sankara "wikilink"), the government had highly
successful land reform, rail and road development, construction of
hundreds of new medical clinics, mass reforestation, vaccinating
millions, ending neo-colonial influence over the country, expanding
women's rights massively and increasing agricultural production by 250%.
However, his failures came from his repression of unions, failure to
raise literacy and his murder in a military coup backed [mainly by
France](Françafrique "wikilink") and the
[USA](Timeline_of_US_Imperialism "wikilink").[^1]

at African Socialism, with the country soon scoring the highest
[HDI](Human_Development_Index "wikilink") in Africa and having some of
the best levels of literacy, life expectancy, economic development and
infant mortality. The country was politically stable and managed to
avoid a coup launched by South Africa and possibly the CIA. However, the
government engaged in several assassinations and torture of dissidents,
but in 2004 René stepped down peacefully and a [representative
democracy](Representative_Democracy "wikilink") developed. Since then
inequality and poverty have increased on the islands.[^2]
