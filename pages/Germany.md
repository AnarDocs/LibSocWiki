## Positives and Negatives

*This only covers Germany from 1990, so no talking about
[that](German_Empire "wikilink"), or [that](Nazi_Germany "wikilink"), or
[that](East_Germany "wikilink").*

### Positives

- Renewable energy use rose from 6.3% in 2000 to 34% in 2016

### Negatives

- Germany has a number of severe issues with pollution. Emissions from
  coal-burning utilities and industries contribute to air pollution and
  acid rain. There are issues of
  [deforestation](deforestation "wikilink") (see [Hambach Forest
  Occupation](Hambach_Forest_Occupation "wikilink")), raw sewage being
  dumped into the Baltic Sea and rivers across the country, as well as
  hazardous waste not being disposed of properly.

## History

### German Empire (1871 - 1918)

### Weimar Republic (1918 - 1933)

### Nazi Germany (1933 - 1945)

*Main Article: [Nazi Germany](Nazi_Germany "wikilink")*

In 1933, Hitler legally took power in Germany and began to restructure
it into the world's only Nazi dictatorship. He also formed alliances
with Italy, Japan, Finland, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria, annexed
Austria and [invaded Czechoslovakia, Poland, Danzig, Denmark, Norway,
Luxembourg, Belgium, Netherlands, France, Yugoslavia, Greece and the
USSR](World_War_II "wikilink"). Although [extensive
plans](New_Order_(Nazism) "wikilink") were made for domination of
Europe, the Nazis began to fail in 1941 after fighting the USSR and USA
and the Nazi government collapsed in 1945 with most high officials
fleeing to other countries, being arrested (and sometimes executed) or
committing suicide.

### Cold War (1945 - 1989)

Germany was placed under the joint administration of the USA, UK, France
and the USSR and was soon famously split between a liberal capitalist
[West Germany](West_Germany "wikilink") (and West Berlin) and an
authoritarian socialist [East Germany](East_Germany "wikilink") during
the Cold War (some have even regarded the West as a
[US](United_States_of_America "wikilink") puppet state and the East as a
[USSR](USSR "wikilink") puppet state). West Germany became far more
prosperous than East Germany, and East Germany became a brutal police
state (most famously with the Stasi and Berlin Wall). However, during
the 1960s through to the 1980s, West Germany saw massive amounts of
unrest and terrorism led by groups like the
[Autonomen](Autonomism_in_Germany "wikilink"),
[Squatters](List_of_Squats "wikilink"), Students,
[RAF](Red_Army_Faction "wikilink"), [Revolutionary
Cells](Revolutionary_Cells_(Germany) "wikilink"), [Rote
Zora](Rote_Zora "wikilink") and the
[Tupamaros](Tupamaros_(Germany) "wikilink").
