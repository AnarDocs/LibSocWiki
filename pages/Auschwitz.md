**Auschwitz** is the name of a complex of 40 [concentration
camps](Concentration_Camp.md "wikilink") within
[Poland](Republic_of_Poland.md "wikilink") built by [Nazi
Germany](Nazi_Germany.md "wikilink") during [World War
II](World_War_II.md "wikilink") and the [Holocaust](Holocaust.md "wikilink")
for the purpose of [mass extermination](Mass_Killing.md "wikilink") of over
a million people.

## History

### Construction

### After the War

## Mass Killings

### Death Toll

Although the historical consensus around holocaust researchers accepts
that over a million people were killed in the camp. Difficulty in
accurately determining the final death toll stems from the Nazis
destroying much of the camps records and burning the bodies of dead camp
victims to stoke [doubt among the remaining
nations](Holocaust_Denial.md "wikilink") about the extent of the holocaust
and to avoid punishment upon capture. Different claims for the death
toll include:

- 1,000,000 (Raul Hilberg)
- 1,082,000 (Yad Vashem)
- 1,471,595 (George Wellers)
- 3,000,000 (Rudolf Höss)
- 4,000,000 ([USSR](Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics.md "wikilink")
  report)[^1]

## Resistance

As soon as prisoners were placed in the camp, secret resistance cells
composed of rebel fighters and ex-soldiers were formed, who's goals
included:

- Help prisoners survive the camp for as long as possible
- Collect information and distribute it to the outside world about Nazi
  atrocities within the camp
- Help organize escapes for prisoners
- Prepare for an eventual uprising which would destroy the camp[^2]

### Uprising

An uprising occurred in [October of
1944](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Eastern_Europe.md "wikilink"),
inspired by the [Warsaw](Warsaw_Ghetto_Uprising.md "wikilink") Revolts,
nearby bombings of [factories](Factory.md "wikilink") by the
[US](United_States_of_America.md "wikilink") air force and the capture of
nearby towns by the [Red
Army](Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics.md "wikilink"). Many in the camp
thought their nightmare would soon finally be over, young Jewish women
like Ester Wajcblum, Ella Gärtner and Regina Safirsztain had been
smuggling small amounts of gunpowder from the munitions factory they
were [forced to work](Slavery.md "wikilink") in.

Gunpowder was wrapped in bits of cloth or paper, hid it on their bodies,
and then passed along in a smuggling chain. Once she received the
gunpowder, Róza Robota then passed it to her co-conspirators in the
Sonderkommando, the special squad of prisoners forced to work in the
camp’s crematoria. Using this gunpowder, the leaders of the
Sonderkommando planned to destroy the gas chambers and crematoria, and
launch the uprising.

On the 7th of October, having learned the Nazis planned to kill them
all, the Sonderkommando rose in revolt, set fire to the crematorium and
attacked the Nazi guards with tools, makeshift weapons, rocks and stolen
guns and grenades. The flames around the crematorium signaled an
uprising, and several hundred people escaped from Auschwitz. Many were
later recaptured and killed by Nazis who forced them to strip and lie
down before being shot. Around 454 people were killed in the uprising,
mostly camp victims. The ringleaders of the uprising, Róza Robota, Ester
Wajcblum, Ella Gärtner and Regina Safirsztain all refused to name any
other co-conspirators and were hung in front of the camp members.[^3]
