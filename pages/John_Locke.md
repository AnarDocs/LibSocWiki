**John Locke** (1632 - 1704) was a doctor and philosopher who's ideas
heavily influenced [liberalism](liberalism "wikilink"), libertarianism
and [capitalism](capitalism "wikilink"), although it has been argued
that his true ideas were closer to [mutualism](mutualism "wikilink") and
[environmentalism](environmentalism "wikilink").
