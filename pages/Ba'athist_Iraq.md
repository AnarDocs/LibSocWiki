*Not to be confused with modern [Iraq](Iraq.md "wikilink") or [Ba'athist
Syria](Ba'athist_Syria.md "wikilink")*

**Ba'athist Iraq** or the **Iraqi Republic** was...complicated. It was
the [state](List_of_States.md "wikilink") that governed
[Iraq](Iraq.md "wikilink") from 1968 to 2003, and is either seen as a
shining example of [anti-imperialism](Anti-Colonialism.md "wikilink"),
[feminism](feminism.md "wikilink"),
[pan-arabism](Arab_Nationalism.md "wikilink") and
[socialism](socialism.md "wikilink")...or an authoritarian dictatorship
that [violently tore apart its environment](Ecocide.md "wikilink") and own
people in the pursuit of further power.

## Positives

- The Ba'ath party made education free and encouraged it for all,
  building thousands of new schools and enrolling hundreds of thousands
  of new students. This led to the elimination of illiteracy in
  1982.[^1]
- Free healthcare for every Iraqi. Every village had a clinic, every
  city had a hospital, and vaccines were mandatory by law. Iraqâ€™s
  healthcare system was heralded as one of the most advanced in the
  region at the time.
- Women enjoyed free education, almost complete gender equality in
  school enrolment and were protected by the law from sexual harassment,
  granted equal pay, a six month maternal leave, and had the right to
  enter politics and own property/businesses.
- Secular code of law that granted freedom of religion for
  [Muslims](Islam.md "wikilink") across all sects as well as
  [Christians](Christianity.md "wikilink"), who were allowed to practice
  openly.

## Negatives

- It has been estimated that 250,000 people were executed by the
  government for speaking out against authoritarianism and secular
  ideas.[^2]
- The famous Mesopotamian Marshes (a historical refuge for escaped serfs
  and slaves) were drained to deny its use as a base for anti-government
  insurgents (including groups as diverse as far-right Islamists and
  far-left communists). Considered one of the [worst environmental
  disasters](List_of_Major_Environmental_Disasters.md "wikilink") of the
  20th century (desertifying 19,000km2 of land), on par with the
  [deforestation of the Amazon](deforestation_of_the_Amazon.md "wikilink")
  and an estimated 275,000 people starved to death as a result of
  declining agricultural yields and the loss, between 80,000 and 120,000
  fled to [Iran](Iran.md "wikilink") and the Marsh Arab culture had been
  annihilated in a [genocidal](Crimes_Against_Humanity.md "wikilink") and
  [ecocidal](Ecocide.md "wikilink") action to increase government
  power.[^3]
