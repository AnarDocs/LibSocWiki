The **Huliaipole Republic** is a [fictional anarcho-communist
society](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Societies.md "wikilink") comprising
of three underground train stations in the Moscow Metro in
[Russia](Russia.md "wikilink") in the [aftermath of a fictional nuclear
war](Metro_Series.md "wikilink").

## Overview

Formed from a defecting faction of the 'Red Line'
([Stalinists](Marxist-Leninism.md "wikilink")) and inspired by the writings
of [Mikhail Bakunin](Mikhail_Bakunin.md "wikilink") and [Peter
Kropotkin](Peter_Kropotkin.md "wikilink") and the actions of [Nestor
Makhno](Nestor_Makhno.md "wikilink"). The area has a main base
(Huliaipole/Voykovskaya Station) a farm (Rechnoy Vokzal) and a cultural
centre (Vodny Stadion) which houses all the writings of Peter Kropotkin
and Mikhail Bakunin. They also use a motorised train carriage with a
machine gun attached to it (resembling a
[tachanka](tachanka.md "wikilink")) and see themselves as the ideological
heir to the [Free Territory of
Ukraine](Free_Territory_of_Ukraine.md "wikilink") and [Black
Army](Black_Army_(Ukraine).md "wikilink") in the [Russian Civil
War](Russian_Civil_War.md "wikilink").[^1]
