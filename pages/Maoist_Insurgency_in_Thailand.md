The **Maoist Insurgency in Thailand** was a 18-year long [guerilla
war](Guerilla_Warfare.md "wikilink") (1965 - 1983) between
[Maoists](Maoism.md "wikilink") (in the [Communist Party of
Thailand](Communist_Party_of_Thailand.md "wikilink")) and the government of
[Thailand](Thailand.md "wikilink"), then [backed by the
USA](Timeline_of_US_Hegemony.md "wikilink"), [Taiwan](Taiwan.md "wikilink")
and [Malaysia](Malaysia.md "wikilink") (the Maoists were backed by
[China](China.md "wikilink"), [Vietnam](Vietnam.md "wikilink") and [North
Korea](North_Korea.md "wikilink")).

## Background

The insurgency was largely caused by anger at the presence of the US
military in the country, inequality, repression of dissidents and the
success of the [Chinese
Revolution](Chinese_Revolution_(1949).md "wikilink"). In the early 1950s, a
group of 50 Thai communists traveled to Beijing where they receiving
ideological and military training. In addition, the Pathet Lao set up
small communist groups in 1961 and sent Thai communists to China, Laos
and Vietnam to train. 350 Thai nationals trained and while they
initially only had French, Chinese and Japanese weapons, they soon
smuggled 3,000 US made weapons and 90,000 rounds of ammunition from Laos
that the US sold to the Laotian army which they sold to smugglers and
eventually the communists. From 1961 to 1965, the Maoists carried out 17
assassinations.

## Events

In 1965, the Maoists began an all out guerilla war against the
government, attacking police and military patrols. They also attempted
to attack US military bases. In addition, after many Kuomingtang
soldiers fled from China and became a part of the regions lucrative
[Opium trade](Illicit_Drugs.md "wikilink") the government repressed this
and destroyed entire villages, providing a new population of recruits.
The Maoists continued a small-scale guerilla war until 1983.

(Thailand)](White_Terror_(Thailand).md "wikilink")*

The government deployed massive counter-insurgency operations to crush
the insurgents and assassinated their leaders and any sympathiers.
Between 200 and 3000 Civilians who were suspected of supporting the
government were placed in oil drums while half-conscious and burnt
alive. Soldiers also raped and murdered university students suspected of
supporting the insurgents.

## Results

The insurgents declared an amnesty by 1980 and only small pockets of
insurgents carried on the struggle, but by 1983 they have given up
completely. Like most Maoist insurgencies, the one in Thailand was a
complete failure.
