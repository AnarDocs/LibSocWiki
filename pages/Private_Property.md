Anticommons](The_Tragedy_of_the_Anticommons.md "wikilink")*

- Private Property tends to lead to lower economic efficiency and worker
  [happiness](happiness.md "wikilink") that what could be achieved via
  [workers' self-management](Workers'_Self-Management.md "wikilink").
- Private Property tends to lead to [worse ecological
  outcomes](Ecocide.md "wikilink") than what can be achieved via the
  [commons](commons.md "wikilink").
- Private Property was established through a massive wave of historical
  violence in the form of [enclosure](enclosure.md "wikilink") and
  [colonialism](colonialism.md "wikilink").
