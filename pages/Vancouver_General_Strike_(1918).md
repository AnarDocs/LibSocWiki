The **Vancouver General Strike of 1918** was the [first general
strike](List_of_General_Strikes.md "wikilink") in
[Canadian](Canada.md "wikilink") history and took place on the [2nd of
August](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_North_America.md "wikilink")
[1918](Revolutions_of_1916_-_1923.md "wikilink"), it lasted only one day.
It was part of a broader strike wave in Canada and the USA.

## Background

The strike had several causes, including:

- Anger at conscription
- Increased cost of living and stagnant wages caused by [World War
  I](World_War_I.md "wikilink")
- Banning of strikes and socialist media
- The [October Revolution](October_Revolution_(Russia).md "wikilink") in
  Russia
- The killing of trade union and anti-war activist Albert "Ginger"
  Goodwin by a private police officer

## Events

The strike occurred after the killing of union activist Albert Goodwin,
and soldiers immediately tried to repress the strike, claiming it to be
a [Bolshevik](Bolsheviks.md "wikilink") conspiracy. Three hundred soldiers
ransacked union officers and forced a union secretary to kiss the Union
Jack (the flag of the [UK](United_Kingdom.md "wikilink")). Although most
union leaders resigned, all were reelected in the ensuing union
elections.
