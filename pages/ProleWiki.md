**ProleWiki** is a Dengist and Maoist-third worldist MediaWiki site
founded in September 2020. The site has promoted itself as *"the
proletarian encylopedia"*. Although a self-described "communist
(Marxist-Leninist)" and "anti-imperialist" project, the site militantly
defends revisionist ideology, imperialism, and social-imperialism.

ProleWiki is infamous among the few socialist circles who are aware of
it for its exceedingly narrow range of accepted ideological trends, with
most of its editors being militant Dengists and those who are not often
getting banned, its extreme sectarianism (with them denouncing
anti-revisionists such as Maoists and Hoxhaists as being revisionists
themselves, falsely) its nearly uncritical support for the economic and
political system of China, Russia, and other modern capitalist states
(of which they codify their support of in their "principles," which were
determined solely by the site's founder in an ad-hoc manner), its
extremely closed and numerically small administration, and its support
of anti-science movements. Despite claiming to maintain 95 fully active
editors as of December 2023, the site in reality has less than a dozen
editors who are even moderately active. The site's administration is
linked with online harassment and cyber-stalking campaigns and uses
their closed Discord server to link to the unrelated websites of their
critics, making the site's community more a web brigade as opposed to
encyclopedists. The site's vetting process has been described by its
administrators as being comparable to Stasi interrogations.

The site is greatly connected to other ideologically-aligned
communities, such as Lemmygrad and GenZedong, and is dependent on these
external sites for their recruitment of editors and preservation of the
ideological line of the site, in many regards functioning as a
front-organization. ProleWiki often serves as a "gateway" for Communists
to be indoctrinated into chauvinistic and revisionary ideology, with the
site actively promoting "Patriotic Socialist" and other
social-chauvinist points of view and allowing users of those persuasions
into the project. For example, the site openly defends members of the
social-fascist and self-declared Patriotic Socialist "Party of
Communists USA" and other far-right figures such as Gonzalo Lira.[^1]

## History

The following is a timeline of major events and developments which have
taken place on ProleWiki.

### Founding and early development (30 September 2020 – 24 November 2021)

ProleWiki was founded on 30 September 2020 by
[Brazilian](Brazil.md "wikilink")
pro-[CPC](Communist_Party_of_China.md "wikilink") propagandist Felipe Forte
and other users of the internet forum Lemmygrad. The initial concept for
ProleWiki likely originated as a reaction to the
[Liberal](Liberalism.md "wikilink") bias found on
[Wikipedia](Wikipedia.md "wikilink"), with ProleWiki initially attempting
to promote itself as "the people's Wikipedia". The then-sole
administrator of ProleWiki, Forte, would firstly attempt to attract
editors via promoting his project to several pro-China
[Telegram](Telegram.md "wikilink") channels and to Lemmygrad. He would also
attempt to self-promote his site on Wikipedia shortly. Also at this
time, the site allowed Marxist-Leninists of many distinct sub-groupings
to join and freely express their views, a policy likely taken out of
pragmatism.[^2] Forte would also create a number of fake accounts and
spambots on the site to boost SEO engagement to make the site more
visible to unknowing newcomers, however, when this action failed to be
yielding regarding account creation, Forte would later falsely claim
that the spambots he covertly made were unintentional and made a system
of "account requests" which, supposedly, was implemented to repel future
spam attacks,[^3] but in truth existed as part of Forte's plot to slowly
turn ProleWiki into a pro-CPC propaganda outlet via preventing
non-revisionist [Marxists](Marxists.md "wikilink") from joining.[^4]
However, the ProleWiki administration persists in denying the nature of
this policy to this day.

While the site was able to enjoy a short-lived spike of editors and
general activity for the first weeks of its existence, and the sole
administrator Forte delegated sysop roles to several other people.[^5]
However, this activity would soon sputter out entirely after the project
progressed into early 2021. In response to this setback, Forte would
later restrict administrator roles to merely two editors who were fully
servile to his personal ideological line - CriticalResist8 and
Jucheguevara (who was a known "Patriotic Socialist" and general holder
of many reactionary views) - and declare himself "supreme comrade" of
ProleWiki,[^6] claiming that the previous democratized administration
was suffering from "absenteeism". However, these administrators were
greatly committed to their positions, and this action was truly done in
order to ensure ProleWiki would become purely a propaganda hub for
Dengist revisionism and ruled in a top-down manner by him personally, as
the other administrators were beginning to question the pro-China
ideological line of ProleWiki.[^7]

### Ideological consolidation and first purge of anti-revisionists (25 November 2021 – 31 July 2022)

In response to increasing discontentment on the part of the editors
concerning the extremely revisionist and anti-Marxist stance Forte had
taken towards the People's Republic of China, Forte would initiate the
first ideologically-motivated purge on ProleWiki on 25 November 2021,
banning a total of 12 editors in the span of just 3 hours (which as at
the time over 90% of all active editors on ProleWiki). In an attempt to
obscure the reasoning behind this mass-banning, Forte would claim that
these editors were "Khruschevites", "Trotskyists", and "Radlibs".
Following this, Forte and the other administrators would openly state
ProleWiki's dogmatic and permanent support for the People's Republic of
China and codified it in their principles.[^8][^9] Forte and the others
in his clique would proceed to completely discard
[Lenin](Lenin.md "wikilink")'s scientific theory of
[imperialism](imperialism.md "wikilink") (calling it "dogmatic" and
"outdated") and started embracing anti-[Stalinist](Stalinist.md "wikilink")
ideology, even downplaying [Stalin](Stalin.md "wikilink")'s contributions
to Marxism.[^10] ProleWiki, from this point forth, would consistently
deny the account requests of anti-revisionists and generally any
Communist who failed to fanatically support China.

### Ideological conflicts and administrative disunity (1 August 2022 – 27 September 2022)

While the internal condition of ProleWiki would remain relatively stable
for most of early-to-mid 2022, with few notable conflicts within the
editorship or administration of ProleWiki, This state of internal
coherence would all rapidly disintegrate in August of 2022 when, along
with others things such as protestations regarding the treatment of
China, the inevitable creation of the page on Patriotic Socialism
happened. The page noted Patriotic Socialism (with regards to the
pseudo-socialist chauvinist ideology found in the United States of
America) as being opportunist and revisionist. However, certain members
within ProleWiki were Patriotic Socialist, including a
then-administrator Jucheguevara, and a conflict would start between
Patriotic Socialist and non-Patriotic Socialist (which included two of
the three administrators) elements within ProleWiki.

This conflict would result in the non-Patriotic Socialist attaining
ideological victory over the Patriotic Socialist elements, with the
correct anti-Patriotic Socialist viewpoint of the article persisting.
Relative peace would remain in the ProleWiki community, however, this
would not be long-lasting. A month after the initial conflict, in
September, the aforementioned administrator with Patriotic Socialist
views, Jucheguevara would, particularly following the creation of the
articles on MAGA Communism and on Infrared, which similar to the one on
Patriotic Socialism, made clear that “MAGA Communism” was anti-Marxist
and revisionist, and the [Infrared
collective](Infrared_(media_collective).md "wikilink") (who are major
“theorists” and promoters of “MAGA Communism”) were chauvinist,
apparently experience escalating discontent with ProleWiki itself.
Jucheguevara would conspire with the Infrared community to effectively
infiltrate ProleWiki and force it to adopt Patriotic Socialist ideology,
and to enforce a pro-Patriotic Socialist viewpoint onto the previously
mentioned articles. The then-administrator, Jucheguevara, would be
banned on 27 September 2022 upon the discovery of his actions by the
other ProleWiki administrators.[^11]

This action, however, was largely done for non-ideological reasons on
the part of the other ProleWiki administrators, with it being less the
case that they cared about combatting social-chauvinist trends and more
simply being the fact that their power within ProleWiki was increasing
being compromised.[^12]

### "Great purge" of anti-revisionists and total adoption of ideological orthodoxy (28 September 2022 – 23 October 2022)

In response to an increasingly militant ideological stance against
anti-revisionist trends, anti-revisionist user
[Wisconcom](https://en.prolewiki.org/wiki/Comrade:Wisconcom) and
like-minded users would begin to protest this anti-Marxist stance which
the administrators were increasingly propagating by August 2022.[^13]
After weeks of this ideological conflict within ProleWiki, the
administrators, after repeatedly losing debates within the community to
the anti-revisionist faction, threatened Wisconcom and other
anti-revisionist users with a ban from the project.

While this would permit some internal peace to develop within the
ideological groupings of ProleWiki, ideological disputes would soon
develop when the ProleWiki administrators purposefully began blocking
the account requests of anti-revisionists – with them instead turning
towards ultra-Dengist communities such as Lemmygrad and r/GenZedong for
editor recruitment almost exclusively[^14][^15] – and openly went on a
propaganda effort against anti-revisionist figures and movements, with
them openly calling [Maoists](Marxism-Leninism-Maoism.md "wikilink"),
Hoxhaists, and other anti-revisionists "dogmatic", "ultra-left",
"sectarian", etc. in their articles.[^16][^17][^18] Following this,
anti-revisionist users, led by user Wisconcom, would send a petition
demanding administrative transparency (of which largely did not exist,
with the administrators holding secret "proceedings" to ban users, make
major decisions, etc., without anybody in the editorship knowing[^19]),
the allowance of anti-revisionist users into the site, the expansion of
the administration to more members, and the development of a [democratic
centralist](Democratic_centralism.md "wikilink") system, rather than the
one-man rule that the lead administrator Forte had over the site.[^20]

The administration would reject this petition, despite its popularity
among the ProleWiki comradeship, claiming that it was a purely
"careerist", "factionalist", and "sectarian" action.[^21]

#### The "great purge" on ProleWiki (23 October 2022)

Immediately following this, the ProleWiki administrators would proceed
to ban editor Wisconcom from the project for his ideological stance and
threat he posed to the power of the administration (a decision acted
upon without any consultation from the wider community, and purely from
the "initiative" if the administrators alone), with him otherwise being
largely supported by the comradeship of ProleWiki for an administrator
role.[^22] However, the banning marked the start of a "great purge"
across the project, with over 25 accounts of mostly anti-revisionist
users (called by the ProleWiki administrators "Hoxhaist worms") being
banned within the span of a few hours. The administrators would later
deny the clearly ideologically-motivated nature of this purge on
ProleWiki, with them later framing Wisconcom, along with other banned
users, for "careerist" actions, even including concocting fake
screenshots and messages in an attempt to discredit these
anti-revisionist users.[^23][^24]

Following this event, the ProleWiki administration would effectively
prohibit any sort of anti-revisionist communists from being allowed into
the project, and would codify this stance in their principles.[^25][^26]

### Recent developments (24 October 2022 – present)

ProleWiki would essentially abandon its original intention of being an
ideological encyclopedia following these sweeping ideological purges.
Its goals and focus has changed from the dissemination of Marxist theory
and economics to generally misinformative "counter-propaganda" in favor
of the actions of Russia and China, with little care for actual
ideological content. The administration has taken the direct of extreme
ideological pragmatism, with them starting to allow editors into the
project based less upon their ideological stance and more upon the
degree of their "support" for so-called "anti-imperialist" and
"socialist" countries such as China, even allowing non-Marxist and
right-wing nationalist elements into their project solely for being
supportive of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, despite lacking any
care or understanding for Marxist theory.[^27]

The ProleWiki administration would, at around new year's eve in
2022-2023, organize several raids against external sites which
criticized ProleWiki, although similarly claiming it was part of a
greater ideological struggle, despite being purely careerist in
motive.[^28][^29]

ProleWiki, a community which has harbored left-communists and other
opportunists for most of its existence, began to receive criticism for
this stance in January 2024. In order to draw public attention away from
this policy, the ProleWiki administration soon began to concede to this
criticism and ban certain left-communists from the site, although they
still refuse to clarify this opposition in their principles and permit
less vocal ultra-leftists to
edit.[1](https://en.prolewiki.org/index.php?title=Special:Log/block&page=Comrade%3ASovietPasiune)

## Ideology

### Marxism-Leninism and support for "actually existing socialism"

ProleWiki, despite claiming to adhere to Marxism-Leninism, has commonly
be described as [Dengist](Dengism.md "wikilink") in most communist circles
due to its militant, if not uncritical support for the People's Republic
of China and its present economic system.[^30][^31] Despite the common
views shared by Dengists that the current state-capitalist system of
China is only applicable to the conditions of that country and nowhere
else, ProleWiki has taken on a more extreme view, with them making
claims that (with minimal concern for Marxist theory) private property
under socialism is only "half-abolished"[^32] (contrary to the views of
nearly every Marxist theorist), that billionaires are a critical part of
a socialist state and must retain a large degree of state power,[^33]
and that "[market socialism](market_socialism.md "wikilink")" (an oxymoron
by the understanding of Marxian economics) is, in the words of the
leading ProleWiki administrator, "a redundancy \[in terms\]. There's no
socialism without markets".[^34]

ProleWiki maintains the commonly-held Dengist view of "actually existing
socialism", and views China, [Laos](Laos.md "wikilink"),
[Vietnam](Vietnam.md "wikilink"), [Cuba](Republic_of_Cuba.md "wikilink"), and
"[People's Korea](Democratic_People's_Republic_of_Korea.md "wikilink")" as
modern dictatorships of the proletariat. ProleWiki has expressed its
uncritical support for China on many occasions,[^35] denying China's
present [social-imperialist](Social-imperialism.md "wikilink") and
[neocolonialist](Neocolonialism.md "wikilink") efforts as a mere "bourgeois
propaganda effort" (despite the editors proceeding to utilize
billionaire-owned Russian and Chinese propaganda outlets and
references),[^36][^37] that it is presently in the socialist mode of
production and a full dictatorship of the proletariat (a stance which
not even the Chinese government holds),[^38][^39] and even a
[Soviet](Soviet_Union.md "wikilink")-style [planned
economy](planned_economy.md "wikilink"), with their sources being posts on
pro-China subreddits which cite no sources whatsoever.[^40] (despite
over 75% percent of the Chinese economy being owned by private, mostly
bourgeois, entities, and even the public sector being run with a lack of
workplace democracy and on a for-profit basis[^41]).

ProleWiki administrator Forte has even asserted that all socialists who
are not supportive of the modern capitalist system of China, regardless
of their ideological stance, are universally "without realizing it,
praising the capitalist system!",[^42] indicating that ProleWiki,
despite its claimed goals, values dogmatic support for "actually
existing socialism" rather than actual revolutionary activities.

### Sectarianism against anti-revisionists

![](ProleWiki_antianti-revionist_ban_vote.png "ProleWiki_antianti-revionist_ban_vote.png")
ProleWiki, particularly since its purge of anti-revisionists in October
2022, has vilified anti-revisionist trends greatly. They have denounced
[Albanian](People's_Socialist_Republic_of_Albania.md "wikilink") communist
leader [Enver Hoxha](Enver_Hoxha.md "wikilink") as degrading into "dogmatic
and opportunistic thinking",[^43] denounced the concept of
social-imperialism as "idealist" and "nonexistent" (and proceeding to
defend reactionary and imperialistic actions by the
Khruschevite-Brezhnevite Soviet Union),[^44] and denounced Maoism as
being "Gonzaloism".[^45] The site has even demonized and otherwise
attacked followers of [Irish
Republicanism](Irish_Republicanism.md "wikilink"), along with other modern
revolutionary and anti-imperialist forces, calling them
"petite-bourgeois" and "counter-revolutionary".[^46] In many other
instances, ProleWiki has even voiced their support for Soviet
revisionist leader Nikita Khrushchev, denying his defamation of Marxism
and social-imperialist actions against socialist states such as
Albania.[^47][^48]

### Defense of imperialism

One aspect which ProleWiki is infamous for is its militant support for
the imperialist actions of the [Russian
Federation](Russian_Federation.md "wikilink") and social-imperialist
actions of the revisionist Soviet Union and the modern People's Republic
of China. ProleWiki completely neglects accounting for the argumentation
of the modern or historical anti-revisionist movement regarding
social-imperialism. This is all in contradiction to ProleWiki's
principle of "anti-imperialism".[^49]

ProleWiki's "criticism" section on their page on social-imperialism
misrepresents the nature of this concept. They[^50] refer to
social-imperialism as "a [reformist](Reformism.md "wikilink") and
revisionist idea" and a concept which is employed solely by
"ultra-leftists" (despite the concept originating from [Vladimir
Lenin](Vladimir_Lenin.md "wikilink")) due to the fact that they maintain
the misunderstanding that anti-revisionists believe no
counter-revolution in [Mao](Mao_Zedong.md "wikilink")'s PRC or Stalin's
USSR took place, and further claim that "neither Mao nor Hoxha ever
explained what the material basis of a "social-imperialist" state would
be, and what the social formation of such a state looked like", despite
writers such as Enver Hoxha trenchantly documenting such details in
their works, such as *The Demagogy of the Soviet Revisionists Cannot
Conceal Their Traitorous Countenance*, of which, clearly articulate the
nature of the Soviet revisionist state and its capitalist
restoration.[^51][^52]

#### Defense of Chinese social-imperialism and neocolonialism

ProleWiki has entirely denied the imperialist nature of the modern
Chinese bourgeois state, and claim that those who are cognizant of this
fact are merely using the " liberal definition of imperialism", despite
most critics of Chinese imperialism employing the Leninist
understanding. They claim that China's neocolonialist Belt and Road and
other imperialist efforts are justified merely because China supposedly
"forgives loans" and they are relatively more popular among China's
comprador and satellite states in Africa, omitting the fact that the
chief export of imperialism is not simply "loans", but finance
capital.[^53][^54]
