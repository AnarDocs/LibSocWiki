**Agnes Ann Inglis** (1870 - 1952) was an
[anarchist](Anarchism.md "wikilink") and librarian who became the main
architect of the [Labadie Collection](Labadie_Collection.md "wikilink") at
the University of Michigan.

## Life

Born to Scottish immigrants, her father was a
[doctor](Healthcare.md "wikilink") and her family was deeply religious and
conservative. Her father died in 1874, and her mother died in 1899. She
began to study history and literature at the University of Michigan
under an allowance from wealth family members. But dropped out and
became a social worker in Chicago, Detroit and Ann Arbor. She became
increasingly sympathetic to immigrant workers and became increasingly
political.

She met and befriended [Emma Goldman](Emma_Goldman.md "wikilink") and
[Alexander Berkman](Alexander_Berkman.md "wikilink"), performing radical
activities during [World War I](World_War_I.md "wikilink") and provided
money for legal support during the [First Red
Scare](First_Red_Scare.md "wikilink") after World War I.

She befriended [Joseph Labadie](Jo_Labadie.md "wikilink") in 1924 and
discovered materials he donated to the University of Michigan had hardly
been cared for, kept in a locked cage. She began to work on the
collection, organizing and cataloguing it, and sent letters to
anarchists across the country asking for information, collecting an
enormour volume of publications and writings for her collection.
Including the papers of [Roger Baldwin](Roger_Nash_Baldwin.md "wikilink"),
[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn](Elizabeth_Gurley_Flynn.md "wikilink") and [Ralph
Chaplin](Ralph_Chaplin.md "wikilink"). Her efforts increased the size of
the collection twentyfold, and she died in 1952.[^1]
