**Dennis** is a well educated
[anarcho-syndicalist](Anarcho-Syndicalism "wikilink")
[peasant](Peasants "wikilink") who lives in [an anarcho-syndicalist
commune](An_Anarcho-Syndicalist_Commune_(Monty_Python) "wikilink") in
[*Monty Python and the Holy
Grail*](Monty_Python_and_the_Holy_Grail_(Film) "wikilink").

## Serious Analysis

Dennis is meant to be a parody of the self-righteous and talkative
nature of the left in general, often not knowing when to shut up about
people who are not interested in their ideas about society.
