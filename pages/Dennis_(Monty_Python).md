[anarcho-syndicalist](Anarcho-Syndicalism.md "wikilink")
[peasant](Peasants.md "wikilink") who lives in [an anarcho-syndicalist
commune](An_Anarcho-Syndicalist_Commune_(Monty_Python).md "wikilink") in
[*Monty Python and the Holy

## Serious Analysis

Dennis is meant to be a parody of the self-righteous and talkative
nature of the left in general, often not knowing when to shut up about
people who are not interested in their ideas about society.
