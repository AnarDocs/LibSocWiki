**Cooperation** or **Mutual Aid** is the process of groups of organisms
working or acting together for common, mutual, or some underlying
benefit, as opposed to working in competition for selfish benefit. It's
been argued extensively that cooperation is the not only the building
block of humanity, but all life and reality itself.

## Examples of Cooperation

- Atoms cooperate in a simple way, by combining to make up molecules.
- The components in a cell work together to keep it living.
- Neurons create thought and consciousness, other cells work together
  and communicate to produce multicellular organisms.
- Organisms form food chains and ecosystems.
- People form families, communities, cities, economies and cultures.
