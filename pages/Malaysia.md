**Malaysia** is a [liberal](Liberalism.md "wikilink"),
[colonial](Colonialism.md "wikilink"), [capitalist](Capitalism.md "wikilink")
[state](List_of_States.md "wikilink") in Southeast Asia, near
[Singapore](Singapore.md "wikilink"), [Indonesia](Indonesia.md "wikilink"),
[Brunei](Brunei.md "wikilink") and [Thailand](Thailand.md "wikilink"),
[Vietnam](Vietnam.md "wikilink") and the
[Philippines](Philippines.md "wikilink").

Having its origins in the Malay kingdoms that were eventually colonised
by the [British Empire](British_Empire.md "wikilink"), it [gained
independence in 1957](Decolonisation.md "wikilink"). It's one of the most
[multi-cultural and multi-ethnic](Ethnic_Diversity.md "wikilink") states in
the world, with large amounts of Malaysian Chinese, Malaysian Indians,
andÂ indigenous peoples. It is a relatively wealthy third world country
but faces several severe environmental issues.
