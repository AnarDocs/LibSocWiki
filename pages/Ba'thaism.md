Ba'thaism is a Stalinist, Ethnonationalist ideology based on the idea of
creating a unified Arab State in the Middle-East and parts of North
Africa and the Caucuse mountains. It is the ideology of the Bashar
Al-Assad's Syrian Government today. It was historically been closely
aligned with the USSR, and has been known for Anti-Semitism, support for
active genocide of Jews in Israel, opposition to Kurdish independence
and supporting ethnic cleansing of [Kurds](Rojava "wikilink"), and
generally unsupportive of Non-Arabs in the Middle-East and North Africa.
