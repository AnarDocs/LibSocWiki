The **Caracazo** or **sacudón**refers to an attempted uprising and
resulting massacres that shook [Venezuela](Venezuela.md "wikilink") in
[1989](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_South_America.md "wikilink").

## Background

The city of Caracas was split between the rich and the poor, with a very
expensive cost of living forced upon an impoverish population. The
left-wing president Carlos Andrés Perez promised to change things and
condemned the [IMF](International_Monetary_Fund.md "wikilink"), calling
them “a neutron bomb that killed people, but left buildings standing.”

However, he soon began to implement IMF policies, leading to a 100%
increase in the price of fuel while bus fares increased by 30%.

## Events

The uprising began in the morning and police were quickly overwhelmed,
leading to a state of emergency and martial law being declared as much
of the constitution was suspended, banning the right to freely
associate, protest, speak and have your privacy protected. In response,
citizens began to shoot soldiers leading to shootouts that killed dozens
of people. Looters took as much food and consumer goods as possible and
the army began to use a tactic of abductions, tortures and extrajudicial
murder. The protests failed to achieve much and quickly died down, with
between 200 and 2,000 people dead.

## Aftermath

The Caracazo failed to achieve long lasting reform, but contributed to a
political climate of increased radicalism and paved the way for [Hugo
Chávez's](Hugo_Chávez.md "wikilink") path to becoming Venezuela's leader.
