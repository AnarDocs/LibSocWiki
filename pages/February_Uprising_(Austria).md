*Not to be confused with the [February
Revolution](February_Revolution_(Russia) "wikilink") in Russia in 1917*

The **February Uprising** or **Austrian Civil War** or **Austrian
Workers' Revolt**refers to a conflict that occurred in
[Austria](Austria "wikilink") between
[anti-fascists](Anti-Fascism "wikilink") and
[fascists](Fascism "wikilink") in
[1934](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Western_Europe "wikilink"),
at least 250 people were killed in the conflict and the fascists were
victorious.

## Events

Paramilitary fascists searched a socialist hotel on the 12th of
February, leading to a gunfight. This led to gunfights across cities and
towns in Austria between the forces, with the anti-fascists concentrated
in urban working class neighbourhoods built around public housing, and
the fascists concentrated in rural areas, the police and the army. Once
the army began using artillery and tanks to destroy apartments in
working class neighbourhoods on the 15th of February, leading to the
uprising ending the next day.

## International Impact

The February Uprising provided inspiration for the [Asturian
Uprising](Asturian_Uprising_(1934) "wikilink") and the [Spanish
Revolution](Spanish_Revolution "wikilink"), the slogan 'better Vienna
than Berlin' became popular among Spanish anti-fascists. The conflict
also created a sharp political divide after the end of Austrian fascism
following [World War II](World_War_II "wikilink"), with this being a
sensitive period of history.
