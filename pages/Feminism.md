**Feminism** is a political philosophy and social movement which seeks
to define, establish, and achieve political, economic, personal, and
social [equality](Gender_Equality "wikilink") of
[sexes](Sex_(Division) "wikilink"). It can also be viewed as an
organized social movement that is in resistance to
[patriarchy](patriarchy "wikilink").

## Tendencies

### Africana

**Africana Womanism** was a term coined in the late 1980s to focus on
the experiences of African women, specific as it relates to
[colonialism](colonialism "wikilink"), [white
supremacy](White_Supremacy "wikilink") and
[christianity](christianity "wikilink"). It is based on 18 principles:

1.  Self-Naming
2.  Self-Definition
3.  Family-Centeredness
4.  Wholeness
5.  Role Flexibility
6.  Adaptability
7.  Authenticity
8.  Black Female Sisterhood
9.  Struggling with males against oppression
10. Male Compatibility
11. Recognition
12. Ambition
13. Nurturing
14. Strengthen
15. Respect
16. Respect for Elders
17. Mothering
18. Spirituality[^1]

### Analytical

### Anarchist

**[Anarcha-feminism](Anarcha-Feminism "wikilink")**or **anarchist
feminism,** **anarcho-feminism,** and/or **anarchx-feminism** refers
towards an effort to synthesize the concerns of feminists towards
patriarchy with the [anarchists](Anarchism "wikilink") opposition
towards all [social hierarchy](Social_Hierarchy "wikilink"), this
manifests in three major ways:

1.  Linking patriarchy as a uniquely important form of hierarchy with a
    significantly important role in the rise of the
    [state](State_(Polity) "wikilink"),
    [capitalism](capitalism "wikilink") and other forms of [social
    hierarchy](Social_Hierarchy "wikilink").
2.  Attempting to integrate anarchist critiques of hierarchy with
    mainstream feminism.
3.  Criticizing sexist tendencies within the anarchist movement.

It is mostly associated with [Emma Goldman](Emma_Goldman "wikilink"),
[Lucy Parsons](Lucy_Parsons "wikilink") and [Mikhail
Bakunin](Mikhail_Bakunin "wikilink").
