**Christopher Agamemnon Pallis**(who went by the penname **Maurice
Brinton**) was a neurologist ([a doctor specialising in the nervous
system](Healthcare "wikilink")), neuroscientist (science of the brain),
translator, and [libertarian
socialist](List_of_Libertarian_Socialists "wikilink") writer.

## Life

Born to a prominent Anglo-Greek family of writers, poets and merchants
living in [India](India "wikilink"), he spent the first years of his
life there before his family moved to
[Switzerland](Switzerland "wikilink") where he went to school and became
fluent in English, French and Greek. During [World War
II](World_War_II "wikilink"), he and his family took the last boat that
was evacuating citizens from France after the Nazi invasion. He studied
medicine at Oxford and joined the Communist Party of Britain, but left
over their support for the [USSR](USSR "wikilink") and became a
[Trotskyist](Trotskyism "wikilink").

He married a working class French [university](university "wikilink")
student in 1947 and dropped out of politics to pursue his medical
studies and career, but rejoined in 1957, writing under the name of
**Martin Grainger**, but was quickly exposed, and not wanting to lose
his job as a neurologist, began writing under the name **Maurice
Brinton**.for the group
[Solidarity](Solidarity_Federation_(UK) "wikilink"). He also wrote the
accepted criteria for brainstem death and the entry of death for
Encyclopaedia Britannica, a masterpiece of historical and medical
summary.

He personally witnessed the Belgian General Strike in 1960, the May
Events of 1968 in France and the Carnation Revolution in Portugal. He
also befriended [Ken Weller](Ken_Weller "wikilink") and was described as
an intelligent, logical and charismatic man. He loved travelling Asia
and studied many tropical diseases and cultures of Asia, and later
became a witness for legal cases involving complex neurological issues.
He also translated the writings of [Cornelius
Castoriadis](Cornelius_Castoriadis "wikilink") from Greek into
English.[^1]
