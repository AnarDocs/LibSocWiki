**For Workers' Power** is a 1965 leaflet written by [Chris
Pallis](Chris_Pallis.md "wikilink") and published by
[Solidarity](Solidarity_(UK).md "wikilink"). It is a short critique of the
nature of capitalism, the failure of trade unions and a call to working
class action.

## Transcript

The standard of living of workers has improved considerably during the
last century. The impoverishment predicted by Marx has not taken place.
But capitalism remains an inhuman system where the vast majority are
bossed at work and manipulated in consumption and leisure. Increased
wages are balanced by speed-up and the creation of artificial needs.
Both East and West, society is still dominated by ruling classes who
control the means of production, use the state in their own interests
and who are prepared to risk the destruction of humanity to defend these
interests.

The decay of the [trade unions](Trade_Union.md "wikilink") and of the
traditional parties has gone much further than is generally admitted.
They cannot be reformed. They have come to terms with the existing
system, of which they are now a key part. The degeneration of working
class organizations, itself the result of the failure of the
revolutionary movement, has been a major factor in creating working
class [apathy](apathy.md "wikilink").

The same applies to the Communist Parties. They are equally impotent and
although they seek to create a superficially different kind of society
(namely [state capitalism](State_Capitalism.md "wikilink") on the
[Russian](USSR.md "wikilink") or [Chinese](China.md "wikilink") model) their
aims can hardly be called socialist.

The road to socialism - and socialism itself - means the conscious and
independent action of workers. It means the end of the division between
leaders and led. By their rigid, hierarchical structure most
"revolutionary" organizations encourage precisely those divisions. A
socialist society will be one in which decisions will be taken by
[workers' councils](Workers'_Council.md "wikilink"), [composed of elected
and revocable delegates](Confederation.md "wikilink"), and where the
[workers themselves will manage
production](Workers'_Self-Management.md "wikilink").

The class struggle today takes mainly "unofficial" forms.
Revolutionaries should be active in these struggles rather than
attempting to take over the traditional organizations. Working class
resistance to the employers and the union leaders is as strong as ever.
But these struggles are mainly reflex actions: their aims are inevitably
limited. If the working class is to learn and generalize its experiences
and if it is to struggle for socialism it must form revolutionary
organizations. These must be instruments of struggle, not a general
staff imposed from the outside.

The idea that socialism can be achieved by an "elite" party, however
"revolutionary" acting on behalf of the working class, is both absurd
and reactionary. *Solidarity* does not present itself as yet another
"leadership" but merely as a tool of struggle.
