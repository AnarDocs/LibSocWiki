The **Camp Logan Mutiny** was a [mutiny](List_of_Mutinies "wikilink") in
Houston, Texas, [USA](United_States_of_America "wikilink") in
[1917](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_North_America "wikilink")
that occurred as [black soldiers demanded equal
treatment](Anti-Racism "wikilink") and an [end to lynchings in the
area](Lynching_in_the_United_States "wikilink"). The mutiny was
unsuccessful.

## Background

Following the United States' entry into [World War
I](World_War_I "wikilink"), black soldiers were sent to Houston the
guard the construction of a new military base in New Mexico. Angered by
[racial abuse](Racism "wikilink") from construction workers, the
enforcement of [Jim Crow Laws](Jim_Crow_Laws "wikilink") and harassment
from the [police](police "wikilink"). Breaking point was reached after
rumours of a black soldier being killed by police spread throughout the
soldiers (the soldier hadn't been killed, but arrested randomly and
beaten for inquiring about the arrest).

## Events

Upon hearing of the killing of a black soldier, 156 soldiers gathered up
weapons and marched into town, where local whites armed themselves. 4
black soldiers were killed as were 15 white locals, including several
police.

## Results

The soldiers were eventually arrested, and 19 soldiers were hung with 63
others being given life sentences. It was later found that many were
charged on faulty evidence, and no whites were brought to trial, being a
classic example of racism in the justice system. Many soldiers were
released 20 years later.
