**Workers' Control in Egypt** has a relatively recent and unfortunately
short history, only developing (to our knowledge) [in the 21st
century](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Northern_Africa "wikilink"),
and was crushed after the [Egyptian Revolution of
2011](Egyptian_Revolution_(2011) "wikilink"). There are two known
instances of [workers' control](Workers'_Control_by_Country "wikilink")
in [Egypt](Egypt "wikilink").

## Lakab Lightbulb Factory

From 2001 to 2006, the Lakab Lightbulb Factory was controlled by its
workers and run as a [worker cooperative](Worker_Cooperative "wikilink")
until the corporation once again reassumed ownership with the help of
the state.

## Ramandan City Textile Factories

After evading taxes and bribing the government, the owner of several
textile factories in Ramadan City was charged and had to spend time in
jail. But he fled the country and the banks took ownership of the
factories, the workers appealed to court to run the factories themselves
to avoid [unemployment](unemployment "wikilink"), which they were
granted in 2008.

> “Working here nowadays is sweet like honey," said Mohamed Youssef, a
> 12-year veteran of the company’s textile embroidery production line.
> “We have more rights and benefits as workers." His wages have
> increased by 30% since the introduction of self-management, and on
> average workers wages have increased by 50% with

However, the factory continues to struggle with debt and insurance fees
accumulated by the previous owner.
