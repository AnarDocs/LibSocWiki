**Amelia "Mildred" Milka Sablich** (1908 - 1994) also known as **Flaming
Milka**, was an [IWW](Industrial_Workers_of_the_World "wikilink")
organizer.

## Life

Amelia's parents immigrated from Volosko, Croatia (then part of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire) to Trinidad, Colorado, USA in 1907, with her
father working as a coal miner. At age 19, she became a leader in the
[Colorado Coal Strike of 1927](Colorado_Coal_Strike_(1927) "wikilink").
She spoke out for the cause of the miners, wearing bright red and
fighting off larger men trying to break the strike. She was arrested,
and upon release gave speeches to raise money to victims of anti-union
violence.[^1]
