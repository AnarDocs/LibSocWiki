*Content Warning: This article contains extensive discussion and
description of torture, rape, murder and genocide*

*Note: We acknowledge that occasionally, US hegemony CAN have benefits
(for instance, [killing Nazis](Anti-Fascism.md "wikilink")) and we do not
support all groups opposed to US hegemony. The US is also not behind
every event in global politics, they are an empire but not omnipotent.
However, we strongly condemn US hegemony as most of it leads to loss of
life and the underdevelopment of countries, condemning hundreds of
millions to a life of poverty.*

A timeline of the actions taken by the [United
States](United_States_of_America.md "wikilink") government in order to
secure greater [hegemony](US_Hegemony.md "wikilink") and power and wealth
at the expense of people, both its own and abroad. We include
authoritarian regimes and dictatorships supported by the US, coups
supported by the US, interference in elections, invasions, suppression
of rebellions (domestic and abroad), bombing campaigns and support for
terrorist or guerilla groups. Actions against piracy and retaliation
against states that the declared war on the US are not included on this
list, except in situations where the US used it for hegemonic gains or
lied to their population.
