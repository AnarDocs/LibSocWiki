The **Rhodesian Railway Strike of 1945** was a
[strike](List_of_Strikes.md "wikilink") in
[1945](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Southern_Africa.md "wikilink")
by railway workers for wage increases and fighting against [anti-black
racism](Anti-Racism.md "wikilink") by [bosses](Boss.md "wikilink") in Rhodesia
(now [Zimbabwe](Zimbabwe.md "wikilink") and [Zambia](Zambia.md "wikilink")).

## Background

Workers in the [British colony of Southern
Rhodesia](British_Empire.md "wikilink"), now Zimbabwe and Zambia, bore an
increased workload to support the war effort during [World War
II](World_War_II.md "wikilink") as extraction of mineral resources
increased, employees of Rhodesia Railways worked upward of 65 hours per
week to transport the minerals to ports on the Indian Ocean. While white
European railway workers had strong unions representing them, black
African employees received inferior treatment and lower pay grades than
whites.

The Rhodesia Railways African Employees Association (RRAEA) was formed
in spring 1944 in response to poor working conditions, and soon rew to
include several hundred members, most of them in the hub city of
Bulawayo. By 1945, it had submitted many written requests to the
company, all of which were ignored. Company managers believed Africans
were incapable of organizing themselves to demand more rights.

Black workers wages were massively cut without them being informed,
combined with an unequal, intimidating work environment in which
superiors would regularly “joke” about firing employees or cutting
wages. Upon payday, unrest began on the 20th of October, 1945.

## Events

A crowd of black workers and supporters waited outside the Rhodesia
Railway Headquarters. Managers ignored them, leading to a strike two
days later involving 2,708 workers. They demanded:

- 500% wage increase
- Informing of wage changes
- Payment in cash rather than rations
- Termination of the current management

The company refused to negotiate, and the strike spread across the
country, shutting down railways. Supplies of food and coal dwindled
across the economy, leading to the formation of a government commission
to investigate the causes of the strike.

## Results

After two weeks, the strike ended. The independent commission
established as a result of the strike raised the workers' wages by
25-30%, improved sick leave practices, and weakened the power of the
Supervisor of Natives. However, the wage increase fell far short of the
requested amount (and still below the country's poverty line), and other
requests, including the right to be paid in cash instead of rations,
were not met.
