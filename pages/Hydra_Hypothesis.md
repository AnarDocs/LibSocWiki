The **Hydra Hypothesis**is a theory developed by [Russell Maroon
Shoatz](Russell_Maroon_Shoatz.md "wikilink") that suggests revolutions are
best defended by decentralised, and not centralised, organisation. It is
considered to be one of the best arguments for [libertarian
socialism](Libertarian_Socialism.md "wikilink") against [authoritarian
socialism](Authoritarian_Socialism.md "wikilink"). If the Hydra Hypothesis
is correct, then it explains much of the failure to build a successful
socialist society in history, from the fall of the [Black
Panthers](Black_Panther_Party.md "wikilink"), the assassination of [Thomas
Sankara](Thomas_Sankara.md "wikilink") and the [October
Revolution](October_Revolution_(Russia).md "wikilink").
