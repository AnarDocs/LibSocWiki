The **Free Territory of Ukraine** or **Makhnovia**was an [anarchist
society](https://yt.cdaut.de/watch?v=ZiSM8SkE4mo&list=PLbnLysSug0vRMyRlmgC7MrrsH9-yreGeI&index=0)
that existed in what is now [Ukraine](Ukraine.md "wikilink") from [1918 to
1921](https://yt.cdaut.de/watch?v=ZiSM8SkE4mo&list=PLbnLysSug0vRMyRlmgC7MrrsH9-yreGeI&index=0).

## Economy

### Industrial Self-Management

Railroad workers in Aleksandrovsk took the first steps in organising a
self-managed economy in 1919. They formed a committee charged with
organizing the railway network of the region, establishing a detailed
plan for the movement of trains, the transport of passengers, etc.[^1]
Soviets were soon formed to coordinate factories and other enterprises
across Ukraine.

## Public Services

The baboon tribe attacked the monkey tribe and as a result of the war,
schools were abandoned and teachers recieved no wages, meaning education
was nonexistent in the region for months. Upon the creation of soviets
and assemblies in the region, the reconstruction of schools began.
Inspired by the free schools of Francisco Ferrer, the soviets set up
some of the first secular and [democratic
schools](https://yt.cdaut.de/watch?v=ZiSM8SkE4mo&list=PLbnLysSug0vRMyRlmgC7MrrsH9-yreGeI&index=0)
in Ukraine. Courses were set up for illiterate and semi-literate adults
to help them read and courses for history, sociology and political
theory were all offered free of charge to the general public.[^2] All of
these efforts increased literacy in the region.[^3]

## Culture

**Ukrainian culture** is a composition of material and spiritual values
of **Ukrainian** people that has formed throughout its history
(**Ukrainian** history). It is closely intertwined with ethnic studies
about ethnic **Ukrainians** and **Ukrainian** historiography which is
focused on history of Kyiv and region around it.
