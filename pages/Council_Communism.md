**Council Communism**or **Councilism**is a [libertarian
marxist](Libertarian_Marxism "wikilink") philosophy that developed after
the [Russian Revolution](October_Revolution_(Russia) "wikilink") and the
[German Revolution](German_Revolution "wikilink"). It believes that
workers' councils are the only effective way to establish a communist
society. Council Communism frequently overlaps with
[anarcho-syndicalism](Anarcho-Syndicalism "wikilink"), but retains a
strong connection to [marxism](marxism "wikilink").

## Steps

Council Communists believe that there are six main steps to achieving
council communism:

1.  Revolutionary class consciousness develops within the working class
    in a severe crisis of the capitalist system (with encouragement and
    agitation by a revolutionary organization).
2.  The workers then establish directly democratic councils in both
    workplaces and communities as the basic organs of the revolution.
    (This arises naturally under periods of intense class struggle, such
    as the Soviets in the Russian Revolution and the Shoras in the
    Iranian Revolution).
3.  Using these councils, the workers then proceed to seize the means of
    production and dismantle the state.
4.  Following from this, society and the economy is managed and
    coordinated by workers' councils, where production in all workplaces
    is managed by their workers via participatory decision-making.
5.  In workplaces too large to assemble all workers, decision-making is
    passed to special councils made up of delegates from their
    respective workplaces (although they still perform normal tasks like
    their fellow workers) which can be recalled at any moment by those
    who elected them in the first place.
6.  As opposed to directly controlling the factory, their task is to
    facilitate discussion and to carry out the decision made by their
    fellow workers that elected them, as well as facilitating
    cooperation between workplaces, as well as coordination between
    consumers/community groups and workplaces committees/councils.
