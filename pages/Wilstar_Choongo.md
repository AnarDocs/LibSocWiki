**Wilstar Choongo** (1964 - 1999) was a
[librarian](List_of_Libertarian_Socialists "wikilink") and
[anarchist](Anarchism "wikilink") who organised the Anarchist & Workers'
Solidarity Movement (AWSM) of [Zambia](Zambia "wikilink"). Born to
[peasant farmers](Peasants "wikilink") in rural Zambia, he joined worked
as a [university librarian](University "wikilink") in Lusaka, the
largest city in Zambia.

He was a self-taught political organiser and managed to get a pay rise
for university staff at the library he worked at in 1996, also
establishing links with the [Workers' Solidarity
Federation](Workers'_Solidarity_Federation_(South_Africa) "wikilink")
(WSF) in [South Africa](South_Africa "wikilink"). He also collected a
lot of anarchist literature and described as "a friendly, shambling man
with a ready grin. [I](Michael_Schmidt "wikilink") well recall sitting
on the bed in his cramped apartment eating a meal of eggs, bread and
oranges and engaging in fervent discussions on anarchist strategies."

He often gave talks about anarchism, [trade
unionism](Trade_Union "wikilink") and government corruption. But he died
of malaria brought about by menigitis at age 35, leaving behind a wife
and three young children. Unfortuantely, the Anarchist & Workers'
Solidarity Movement collapsed after his death.[^1]
