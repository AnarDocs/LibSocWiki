The **Russian Civil War** took place in the aftermath of the fall of the
[Russian Empire](Russian_Empire.md "wikilink") and the
[two](February_Revolution_(Russia).md "wikilink")
[revolutions](October_Revolution_(Russia).md "wikilink") from 1917 to 1922.
The war was largely fought between 'Reds' (composed of the Bolsheviks
and their allies) and the 'Whites' (composed of various anti-Bolshevik
groups, including monarchists, republicans, capitalists and even more
moderate socialists). There were also more independent anarchist groups
(like the [Black Army](Black_Army_(Ukraine).md "wikilink")) and 'Green
Armies' who defended their towns and land from exploitation by others.

An estimated 7,000,000 to 12,000,000 were killed as a result of the war
(compared to 15,000,000 to 19,000,000 deaths in [World War
I](World_War_I.md "wikilink")[^1]). Russia's economy was destroyed, it is
estimated that the total output of mines and factories in 1921 had
fallen to 20% of the pre-World War level, and many crucial items
experienced an even more drastic decline. For example, cotton production
fell to 5%, and iron to 2%, of pre-war levels.
