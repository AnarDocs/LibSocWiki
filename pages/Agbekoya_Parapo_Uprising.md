The **Agbekoya Parapo Uprising** was a [peasants'
revolt](Peasants#List_of_Peasant_Rebellions "wikilink") and [class
war](Class_War "wikilink") from [1968 to
1969](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Western_Africa "wikilink")
within what we now call [Western
Nigeria](Federal_Republic_of_Nigeria "wikilink"). The uprising was
highly successful and led to a better of economic conditions for farmers
in the area and a significant expansion of political rights.

## Background

Western Nigeria had been one of the worlds most profitable areas for
[cocoa production](Agriculture "wikilink"), produced by a system of
[farmers' cooperatives](Worker_Cooperative "wikilink") rooted in
indigenous culture. The state had hoped to expand its tax base by
regulating and [taxing](Taxation "wikilink") this economy. They began to
manage the cooperatives through 'marketing boards' (decreasing
productivity, as bureaucracy became more and more common), and installed
officers to collect taxes. Corruption set in very quickly, as officers
headed extortion rings and demanded bribes, and the government only saw
the farmers as pawns to be manipulated for political gain.[^1]

## Events

Peasants began to march from town to town, attacking government symbols
of power, such as offices and courts, while executing government
officials. Prisoners were freed from jails and violence with the police
and military escalating, with the government eventually caving in to the
peasants demands.[^2]

## Results

The uprising led to five major changes, which benefited the peasants:

- The removal of the corrupt officials administering local villages
- Reduction in the flat tax rate
- The end of force
- An increase in the price of cocoa
- The improvement of [roads](Transportation "wikilink") leading to the
  villages[^3]
