[Can Masdeu](Can_Masdeu "wikilink") [squat](Squatting "wikilink"),
[Barcelona](Barcelona_Squat's "wikilink"), [Spain](Spain "wikilink") in
[2002](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism "wikilink").

## Events

In April of 2002, over 100 [police](police "wikilink") came to evict 11
squatters, and they held of police efforts to remove them by locking
themselves in rooms, hanging off harnesses on the building and balancing
of seesaws which no occupant could be removed without dropping or
killing the other. The police attempted to starve them out over three
days, and a solidarity movement formed.[^1] They argued with and
attacked the police, blocked traffic and attacked banks, real estate
offices and a McDonalds.[^2]

## Result

The eviction was stopped and the squatted social center survives to this
day.[^3]
