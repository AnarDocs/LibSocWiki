**Anti-Fascism** is opposition to [fascist](Fascism.md "wikilink")
ideologies, groups and individuals. The anti-fascist movement began in a
few European countries in the 1920s, and eventually spread to other
countries around the world. It was at its most significant shortly
before and during [World War II](World_War_II.md "wikilink"), where the
fascist Axis powers were opposed by many countries forming the Allies of
World War II and dozens of resistance movements worldwide. After World
War II, anti-fascism has become an official policy of many states and
numerous decentralized militant groups continue to fight fascism around
the world. Anti-fascism has been an element of movements holding many
different political positions, including [social
democratic](Social_Democracy.md "wikilink"), nationalist,
[liberal](Liberalism.md "wikilink"), conservative, communist,
[marxist](Marxism.md "wikilink"), [trade unionist](Trade_Union.md "wikilink"),
[anarchist](Anarchism.md "wikilink"), socialist, and centrist viewpoints.

## History

*See Also: [Timeline of
Anti-Fascism](Timeline_of_Anti-Fascism.md "wikilink")*

Anti-fascism has its origins in black resistance to the
[KKK](Ku_Klux_Klan.md "wikilink") in the
[USA](United_States_of_America.md "wikilink") in the late 1800s and
republicans fighting anti-semites during the [Dreyfus
Affair](Dreyfus_Affair.md "wikilink") in [France](France.md "wikilink"). The
first militant anti-fascist organisation emerged in 1921 in Italy, known
as the [Arditi del Popolo](Arditi_Del_Popolo.md "wikilink"), who engaged in
gunfights with fascists and violently broke up fascist meetings.
