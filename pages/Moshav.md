**Moshavim**are an [intentional
community](Intentional_Community.md "wikilink") and
[cooperative](cooperative.md "wikilink") in [Israel](Israel.md "wikilink"),
they are different to [Kibbutzim](Kibbutzim.md "wikilink") as they do not
farm in [common](Commons.md "wikilink"), but on individually owned land of
fixed and equal size. The first Moshav, Moshav Nahalal was founded in
[September
1921](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Western_Asia.md "wikilink") and
there are 451 Moshav in Israel.

## Decision-Making

Moshavim are governed by an elected council.

## Economy

Workers produced crops and goods on their properties through individual
and/or pooled labour and resources and used profit and foodstuffs to
provide for themselves. Community projects and facilities were financed
by a special tax (Hebrew: מס ועד‎, *mas va'ad*, lit. *committee tax*).
This tax was equal for all households of the community, thus creating a
system where good farmers were better off than bad ones, unlike in the
communal kibbutzim where (at least theoretically) all members enjoyed
the same living standard.

## Culture

Because the moshav organisation retained the family as the centre of
social life, it was much more attractive to traditional Mizrahi
immigrants in the 1950s and early 1960s; they eschewed bold experiments,
like communal child-rearing or equality of the sexes, practiced by the
more radical communal kibbutz. These so-called "immigrants' moshav"
(Hebrew: מושב עולים‎, *moshav olim*) were one of the most-used and
successful forms of absorption and integration of Oriental immigrants;
it allowed them a much steadier ascent into the middle class than did
life in some development towns. For this reason, the moshav became
largely a Mizrahi institution, whereas the kibbutz movement remained
basically an Ashkenazi institution.[^1]
