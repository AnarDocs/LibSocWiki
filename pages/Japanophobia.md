During the [2020 Coronavirus Pandemic](Coronavirus_Pandemic.md "wikilink"),

Japan's public service broadcaster NHK, which provides a list of
overseas safety risks for traveling, in early 2020 listed anti-Japanese
discrimination as a safety risk when traveling to France and some other
European countries, possibly as a result of fears over the COVID-19
pandemic among other factors. Signs of rising anti-Japanese sentiment in

service, and least one Japanese restaurant has been vandalized. A group
