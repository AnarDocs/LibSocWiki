**Debt: The First 5000 Years** is a 2011
[book](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Media.md "wikilink") by [David
Graeber](David_Graeber.md "wikilink") which explores the historical
relationship of debt with social institutions such as barter, marriage,
friendship, slavery, law, religion, war and government; in short, much
of the fabric of human life in society. It draws on the history and
anthropology of a number of civilizations, large and small, from the
first known records of debt from [Sumer](Sumer.md "wikilink") in 3500 BC
until the present.

## Summary

### On The Experience of Moral Confusion

Recounting a garden party at Westminster Abbey in 2009, David Graeber
describes a conversation with an anti-poverty lawyer about his actions
in the [Global Justice Movement](Global_Justice_Movement.md "wikilink").
Specifically aimed at cancelling all third world debt, which the woman
regarded as unfair, as 'Surely one must pay ones debts'. This doesn't
even make sense from an economic perspective, since lenders need to
accept a degree of risk or else the whole system would collapse in a
day. He realized that she was making a moral argument, which deeply
bothered him, as that [language](language.md "wikilink") is often used to
justify authoritarianism, kidnapping, war, violence, genocide and
poverty. Drawing an example about how austerity had killed 10,000 people
in [Madagascar](Republic_of_Madagascar.md "wikilink") due to the cutting of
mosquito net programs for the
[IMF](International_Monetary_Fund.md "wikilink"). The basic moral statement
at the heart of 'one must pay ones debts' makes it the easiest method to
justify violent actions. With the third-world nations owing great
amounts of money to the developed world having eerie similarities with
the [colonial](Colonialism.md "wikilink") era, and how many nations
indebted to the [USA](United_States_of_America.md "wikilink") allow for the
construction of US military bases on their territory, allowing for a new
global empire.
