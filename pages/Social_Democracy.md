**Social Democracy** (commonly called **Democratic Socialism**, also
known as **Welfare Capitalism**, **Welfare Statism** or **Liberal
Socialism**) is the idea that society should be run by a representative
democracy that guarantees both positive and negative freedoms via a
welfare state, [nationalisation](nationalisation "wikilink") of certain
industries and public services and regulations to protect workers.

Although Social Democracy's support for the state and capitalism will
cause an obvious conflict with libertarian socialists, there is a great
deal of division over whether or not to support it. Figures like [Noam
Chomsky](Noam_Chomsky "wikilink") have argued for limited support in
order to win temporary gains in [class
struggle.](Class_Struggle "wikilink") Whilst others (like [Peter
Gelderloos](Peter_Gelderloos "wikilink") and [Colin
Ward](Colin_Ward "wikilink")) have argued that supporting it takes the
energy out of other political projects we could be taking

## History

### Origins

Social Democracy began in the early 1860s as a tendency within the
[International Workingmen's
Association](International_Workingmen's_Association "wikilink") led by
theorists who rejected [Marx](Karl_Marx "wikilink") and
[Bakunin's](Mikhail_Bakunin "wikilink") idea of a violent
[revolution](revolution "wikilink") and instead advocating for the
formation of [political parties](Political_Party "wikilink") and the
winning of reforms to improve the standing of the [working
class](Working_Class "wikilink").

### Split from Socialism

### Gaining Power

### Dominance in the First World

Following [World War II](World_War_II "wikilink") and until the 1970s,
social democracy became the norm in much of the first world. Figures
like [Gough Whitlam](Gough_Whitlam "wikilink") in Australia, [Olof
Palme](Olof_Palme "wikilink") in Sweden, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Lyndon
B. Johnson in the USA, Clement Atlee in the UK and other figures are
usually seen as the main architects of social democracy. This period is
correlated with some of the highest amounts of prosperity and scientific
innovation in the first world.

### Repression in the Third World

However, things were not so bright in much of the third world, as first
world nations organised the assassinations and disruptions of left-wing
economies that threatened to build viable social democracy in the third
world (partially contributed to our unnaturally high amount of extreme
poverty). Leaders like [Salvador Allende](Salvador_Allende "wikilink")
in [Chile](Chile "wikilink"), Juan Jose Aravelo in Guatemala.

### Decline

Beginning in the 1970s, the [ruling class](Ruling_Class "wikilink")
became increasingly anxious about a '[crisis of
democracy](Crisis_of_Democracy "wikilink")' within much of the first
world, as protests and strikes began to impede the progress of
capitalism and bring the entire system into question. Police repressed
social movements and trade unions in several major battles, COINTELPRO
and several assassinations destroyed radical opposition to present
society and many other social movements were
[co-opted](Co-optation "wikilink"). This set the stage for
[austerity](austerity "wikilink") and
[neoliberalism](neoliberalism "wikilink"), disastrous policies which has
led to increasing levels of unemployment, insecure work, mental illness,
low wages, insecure housing, destruction of the environment and
political authoritarianism.

The major exception to this has been Latin America, where in response to
numerous social upheavels and revolutions (the [Zapatista
Revolution](Zapatista_Revolution "wikilink"), [Bolivian Water
War](Bolivian_Water_War "wikilink") and
[Argentinazo](Argentinazo "wikilink"), just to name a few) led to a
string of social democrats and socialists being elected to lead
[states](State_(Polity) "wikilink") in an event known as the [Pink
Tide](Pink_Tide "wikilink") throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s.
These governments successfully reduced poverty in massive waves, had
secured greater rights for minorities and made significant measures to
protect the environment. But by the mid-2010s, most of these states had
been hit by major [economic crashes](Capitalist_Crisis "wikilink") or
its politicians had become seduced by corruption, leading to a surge in
support for right-wing and fascist candidates across Latin America known
as the [blue or brown tide](Blue_Tide "wikilink").[^1]

### Potential Resurgence

Support for social democracy is growing across most of the population
within first world countries. Popular politicians like Bernie Sanders,
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Jacinta Ardern and Jeremy Corbyn demonstrate
potential for more social democracy, however, given the still weak
nature of unions and strong belief that voting alone can fix the system,
this seems unlikely.

## Criticisms

According to socialists ([libertarian](Libertarian_Socialism "wikilink")
and [authoritarian](Authoritarian_Socialism "wikilink")), social
democracy can be criticised on numerous grounds:

- Social democracy creates a narrative where support for political
  parties in the most practical method to achieve change in the world,
  despite social democracy historically depending on the existence of
  large and strong [trade unions](Trade_Union "wikilink") willing to
  carry out [strikes](Strike "wikilink").
- Social democracy is simply a new method to strengthen capitalism and
  neutralize working class resistance, upon sufficient neutralization of
  the [working class](Working_Class "wikilink"), social democracy will
  be [destroyed](Austerity "wikilink") in order to increase profits for
  the [ruling class](Ruling_Class "wikilink")
- Attempts to reduce [unemployment](unemployment "wikilink") without
  providing [workers'
  self-management](Workers'_Self-Management "wikilink") will result in
  increased [inflation](inflation "wikilink") and
  [prices](Price "wikilink") on commodities (which is what happened in
  the [1970s economic crisis](1970s_Economic_Crisis "wikilink") which
  justified [neoliberalism](neoliberalism "wikilink"))
- Social democracy cannot resolve the fundamental problems of
  capitalism, such as [environmental destruction](Ecocide "wikilink"),
  [economic crashes](Economic_Crisis "wikilink"),
  [alienation](alienation "wikilink") and
  [inefficiency](Capitalist_Inefficiency "wikilink").
