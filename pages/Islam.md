**Islam** is an [organized religion](Organized_Religion.md "wikilink") that
teaches that there is only one true god (Allah) and that Muhammad is the
messenger of god. Followers of Islam are usually called **Muslims**. It
is the second largest religion in the world (after
[Christianity](Christianity.md "wikilink")), with over 1.8 billion
followers or 24% of humanity. It is the fastest growing religion in the
world and most muslims split between Sunni Islam (85-90%) and Shia Islam
(10-15%).

## Key Concepts

### Five Pillars of Islam (Sunni)

The most important thing for a muslim to do is to follow the Five
Pillars of Islam, which are Shahada (Faith), Salah (Prayer), Zakāt
(Charity), Sawm (Fasting) and Hajj (Pilgrimage to Mecca).

## Islamic Libertarian Socialism

Certain schools of thought within Islam have argued for a society that
reflects principles similar to [Libertarian
Socialism](Libertarian_Socialism.md "wikilink"). Notably the Kharijites,
Najdat, Nakkariyah, Ibāḍiyya and Muʿtazilites. Notable muslims who have
advanced positions similar to or were inspired by libertarian socialism
include [Ali Shariati](Ali_Shariati.md "wikilink"), Jalal Al-e-Ahmad,
Sheikh Bedreddin, Hakim Bey, [Si Mahmoud
Saadi](Si_Mahmoud_Saadi.md "wikilink") and Abdul Karim Jossot.
