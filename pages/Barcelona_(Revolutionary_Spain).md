## Public Services

### Public Transport

After the city was liberated from fascist control by
[anarcho-syndicalists](Anarcho-Syndicalism.md "wikilink"), the owners of
the public transport systems fled, and the
[CNT](National_Confederation_of_Labour_(Spain).md "wikilink") democratised
them. Buses, subway, streetcars - were separate union "sections", as
were the repair depots. These all were managed through elected
committees, answerable to [assemblies](Democratic_Assembly.md "wikilink")
of the workers. An engineer was elected to each administrative
committee, to facilitate consultation between manual workers and
engineers. There was an overall assembly for decisions that affected the
transit-system as a whole. There was no top manager or executive
director. A 7-member elected worker committee was responsible for
overall coordination.

#### Streetcars/Tram

![](Cnt-tram.jpg "Cnt-tram.jpg") The main public transport system was a
large system of streetcars/trams that operated 60 routes across the city
and surrounding suburbs. Before the revolution, the system was
maintained by 7,000 people, 6,500 of whom were members of the CNT.
During the initial days of fighting in the [Spanish Civil
War](Spanish_Civil_War.md "wikilink"), many transport workers fought in the
fighting and even used an armoured streetcar/tram. The system had been
badly damaged, tracks were unworkable, overhead wires snapped, equipment
boxes shot and tracks blocked by barricades. Within 5 days, the workers
had completely repaired the system and re-painted the cars in the red
and black colour scheme of anarcho-syndicalism. Previously, the
equipment boxes of the electric company had been placed in the middle of
streets, leading to tracks being tightly curved around them, frequently
leading to derailments. Afterwards, a move of the boxes and
straightening of the tracks was made between the transport and
electrical workers. In addition, electrical wiring powering the tracks
were moved from the centre of the tracks to the side in order to be
safer.

Barcelona Tramways had operated with a fare zone system which meant that
it cost more for people in the outer working class suburbs to get into
the city center. The worker-run transit operation switched to a flat
fare throughout the metropolitan area, to equalize fare costs to riders.
Despite this lowering of the fare, the worker-run transit system
operated at a profit. A sizeable part of this profit was donated to the
anti-fascist war effort. Workers also donated their time on Sundays to
work in factories set up in transit system workshops to make munitions
for the anti-fascist armies. New tools and machinery from France and the
USA were purchased to give each section a surplus of spare parts for
repairs. Before the revolution, the private company had only made about
2% of the repairs through its own workshops and were set up only to deal
with the most urgent repairs. But within a year under workers
management, the workshops were manufacturing 98% of the parts used. They
were able to do this and still make a profit, despite a 150% increase in
prices of raw materials.
