**Worker Recuperation** refers to [workers](Working_Class "wikilink")
taking over their former workplaces and running them as [worker
cooperatives](Worker_Cooperative "wikilink") within a
[capitalist](Capitalism "wikilink") economy. This usually happens after
a workplace goes bankrupt, as opposed to a [work-in](Work-In "wikilink")
which employs [temporary
self-management](Workers'_Self-Management "wikilink") as a strike
tactic.
