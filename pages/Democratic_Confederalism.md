**Democratic Confederalism** is a [libertarian
socialist](Libertarian_Socialism.md "wikilink") ideology and governing
ideology of [Rojava](Rojava.md "wikilink") that notably stresses an
understanding of the history behind the
[state](State_(Polity).md "wikilink") and
[patriarchy](patriarchy.md "wikilink") as a necessity to abolish
hierarchies. It was developed by [Abdullah
Öcalan](Abdullah_Öcalan.md "wikilink"), drawing on the work of
[Communalist](Communalism.md "wikilink") [Murray
Bookchin](Murray_Bookchin.md "wikilink").
