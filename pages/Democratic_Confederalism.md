**Democratic Confederalism** is a [libertarian
socialist](Libertarian_Socialism "wikilink") ideology and governing
ideology of [Rojava](Rojava "wikilink") that notably stresses an
understanding of the history behind the
[state](State_(Polity) "wikilink") and
[patriarchy](patriarchy "wikilink") as a necessity to abolish
hierarchies. It was developed by [Abdullah
Öcalan](Abdullah_Öcalan "wikilink"), drawing on the work of
[Communalist](Communalism "wikilink") [Murray
Bookchin](Murray_Bookchin "wikilink").
