## Life

### Early Life

She had been born as one of 18 children to a highly religious family
where her father was a priest in [Norway](Kingdom_of_Norway "wikilink").
She quickly grew to question and distrust religious authority, and
became a journalist after high school. During [World War
I](World_War_I "wikilink"), she met and fell in love with the
anarcho-syndicalist [Albert Jensen](Albert_Jensen "wikilink") and began
working for the [Central Organisation of the Workers of
Sweden](Central_Organisation_of_the_Workers_of_Sweden "wikilink"). She
developed an interest in sexual liberation and the advancement of
reproductive rights, traveling around Scandinavia giving lectures on
safe sex, abortion and sexual freedom.

During [World War II](World_War_II "wikilink"), she helped several gay
people and Jews find refuge in [Sweden](Kingdom_of_Sweden "wikilink") as
they fleed [Nazi](Nazism "wikilink") persecution. She became an editor
for several magazines dealing with psychology and sexual knowledge. She
continued to travel and lecture and spread information about sexual
health, doing so nearly put her in [prison](prison "wikilink") several
times.[^1]

## Quotes

"I dream of the day when all the children who are born are welcome, all
men and women are equal and sexuality is an expression of sincerity,
pleasure and tenderness."[^2]
