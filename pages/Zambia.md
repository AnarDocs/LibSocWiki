The **Republic of Zambia** is an authoritarian
[capitalist](Capitalism "wikilink") [state](List_of_States "wikilink")
in Southern Africa, bordering the states of [Malawi](Malawi "wikilink"),
[Mozambique](Mozambique "wikilink"), [Zimbabwe](Zimbabwe "wikilink"),
[Botswana](Botswana "wikilink"), [Namibia](Namibia "wikilink"),
[Angola](Angola "wikilink"), [DR
Congo](Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo "wikilink") and
[Tanzania](Tanzania "wikilink").

## History

### Human Settlement

Humans have lived in territory claimed by the state for at least 200,000
years, as the first human fossils discovered in Africa were found there
(in 1921). The first societies, known as the Khoisans, were nomadic
foragers who collected fruit and nuts and occasionally hunting antelope.

### Iron Age

In the 400s, the [Bantu Migration](Bantu_Migration "wikilink") occurred,
who developed self-sufficient villages of wattle-and-daub huts,
introducing [agriculture](agriculture "wikilink"), growing sorghum and
beans while raising cattle and goats. They also had iron tools and
weapons, alongside pottery making. The Khoisan population was destroyed
by a [genocide](genocide "wikilink") or assimilated into the new
culture.

Trade began to develop in the new society, and copper coins were used as
a currency as mining intensified. The society exported ivory and
imported cotton textiles, rivers were also dammed to give societies
access to [water](water "wikilink"). Four new kingdoms, the
Kazembe-Lunda, Bemba, Chewa and Lozi emerged around the Zambezi river as
the most powerful [states](State_(Polity) "wikilink") in the region.

### European Colonialism

Representatives of the Portuguese Empire came to the territory via
Mozambique in the 1700s, trading between the empire and the new kingdoms
of Mwata Kazembe and Barotseland began. In the newly formed Makololo
Empire, which refused to trade with Ottomans and Portuguese, it collapse
into a civil war over fights between the ruling class over who should
rule, destroying the empire.

In 1888, during the Scramble for Africa, Cecil Rhodes obtained mining
rights from local chiefs. The [British South Africa
Company](British_South_Africa_Company "wikilink") took control of the
territory later that year and used it as a source of labour. It became a
major exporter of copper, producing 13% of the world's copper in 1938,
although in [1935 a strike broke
out](Zambian_Copperbelt_Strike_(1935) "wikilink") over unsafe working
conditions and high taxes. Triggering another strike in 1940 during the
high demand for copper in [World War II](World_War_II "wikilink"). After
the war, [railway workers across the country went on
strike](Rhodesian_Railway_Strike_(1945) "wikilink").

### Independence

In 1964, Zambia was granted independence from the [British
Empire](British_Empire "wikilink") as part of
[decolonisation](Decolonisation_in_Africa "wikilink"). The ideology of
[African Socialism](African_Socialism "wikilink") was adopted, building
[an economy based around central planning and nationalisation modeled of
Julius Nyerere's policies](Authoritarian_Socialism "wikilink") in
Tanzania as well as building relations with [China](China "wikilink")
and Yugoslavia. In 1972 Zambia became a dictatorship, banning all
political parties and firing dissidents in the government. The policies
of [import substitution](Import_Substitution "wikilink") worked until
1975, where the economy contracted by 30% between 1975 and 1990. This
was because copper prices fell due to the USSR flooding the market,
leading Zambia to take on loans from the IMF and World Bank, leading to
the imposition of Structural Adjustments.

Zambia also allied itself with
[anti-colonial](Anti-Colonialism "wikilink") movements in Africa,
allowing [ANC](African_National_Congress "wikilink") members from South
Africa to take shelter in the country, leading to occasional raids by
South African special forces. The Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army
had a military base in the country, and shot down two civilian airlines
with [USSR](USSR "wikilink") supplied heat-seeking missiles. This led to
the closing of Zambia's borders, leading to electricity and food
shortages as refugees poured into the country from
[Angola](Angolan_Civil_War "wikilink").

### Collapse of Dictatorship

Massive discontent with the dictatorship and commodity shortages
occurred, leading to a [strike wave in
1981](Zambian_Strike_Wave_(1981) "wikilink"), protests in the late 1980s
and [massive food riots in 1990](Zambian_Food_Riots_(1990) "wikilink")
and an attempted military coup. This resulted in the ban on political
parties being lifted and the first elections occurring in 1991, ending
one-party rule. The new government, led by a former trade unionist,
began a campaign of massive austerity and privatisation leading to
falling incomes and economic stagnation. Many more coups have been
attempted and the country remains authoritarian to this day, despite
this bleak future, copperminers' went on strike in
[2007](Zambian_Miners'_Strike_(2007) "wikilink") and
[2012](Zambian_Miners'_Strike_(2012) "wikilink").
