**Killing Hope: U.S. Military and CIA Interventions Since World War II**
is a 2003 [book](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Books "wikilink") by
[William Blum](William_Blum "wikilink") which discusses...[US
military](United_States_of_America "wikilink") and [CIA](CIA "wikilink")
interventions since [World War II](World_War_II "wikilink"), it outlines
the efforts to build an [American Empire](American_Empire "wikilink") in
the second half of the 20th century through a combination of invasions,
[bombings](Bombing "wikilink"), supporting coups, backing terrorists and
interfering in elections.

## Summary

The overall premise of the book is that the USA has constructed an
advanced neo-colonial empire via invasions, bombings, coups, election
interference, supporting terrorists and covert assassinations.
Documenting many episodes from the second half of the 20th century, the
book argues the US uses anti-communism (and later 'fighting terrorism'
and 'spreading democracy') as ideological justifications for this
project, claiming to want freedom for all but actually fighting any
country that doesn't bend to the will of the US government or US
corporations. From the moment of the [first 'socialist'
revolution](October_Revolution_(Russia) "wikilink"), the US has been
acting as a global policeman to ensure that people don't get ideas like
'redistribution of wealth', 'common ownership', 'workers control of
industry' or 'direct democracy'.

### 1. China 1945 to 1960s: Was Mao Tse-tung just paranoid?

After the end of [World War II](World_War_II "wikilink"), the US began
to interfere in the [Chinese Civil War](Chinese_Civil_War "wikilink") in
support of the [Kuomingtang](Kuomingtang "wikilink") (despite much of
the faction being composed of collaborates with
[Japan](Japanese_Empire "wikilink"). Deploying 100,000 US soldiers to
the area, training 500,000 Kuomingtang soldiers, airlifting supplies in,
bombing pro-communist villages and providing political support for the
Kuomingtang. After this failed, the US supported the new state of
[Taiwan](Taiwan "wikilink") (despite its repression and repeated attacks
on [China](China "wikilink"), killing tens of thousands of people) and
supporting the secret Kuomingtang army in northern
[Myanmar](Myanmar "wikilink"), one which created a [giant illegal heroin
industry](Drug_Trafficking "wikilink") (which the CIA helped transport)
and killed more people in China, in addition to being a massive
violation of sovereignty for Myanmar.
