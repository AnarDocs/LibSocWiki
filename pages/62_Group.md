The **62 Group** was a militant [anti-fascist](Anti-Fascism.md "wikilink")
group active in the
[1962](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Northern_Europe.md "wikilink")
in the [UK](United_Kingdom.md "wikilink") to fight
[fascist](Fascism.md "wikilink") groups, new and old. Based on the old [43
Group](43_Group.md "wikilink"), the group assaulted fascist newspaper
vendors and forcibly disrupted indoor [Mosley](Oswald_Mosley.md "wikilink")
meetings. On one occasion in July 1962 this led to a riot in London's
Trafalgar Square, when Jordan tried to address a crowd while standing in
front of a large banner which read: "Free Britain from Jewish
Control".[^1] On one occasion, they even dressed up like Blackshirts to
sneak into Mosleyâ€™s headquarters. Once inside, they stole records and
trashed the place, nearly wiping out the entire fascist resurgence in
just a year.[^2]
