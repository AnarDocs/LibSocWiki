The **Swiss Railway Strike of 2008** was a
[strike](List_of_Strikes.md "wikilink") in
[Switzerland](Switzerland.md "wikilink") in
[2008](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Western_Europe.md "wikilink")
by railway workers in order to protect against job losses. It was at the
beginning of a [global wave of
unrest](Revolutions_of_2008_-_2014.md "wikilink").

## Background

Following the [Great Recession](Great_Recession.md "wikilink") in 2007 and
2008, a major Swiss railway country was rumoured that it would lay off
more than 400 workers, but didn't say who. The trade union demanded
information on who would be fired. During a meeting with the workers and
the bosses, the boss confirmed it was true and the workers threw the
boss out of the meeting hall and went on strike.

## Events

The strikers formed solidarity committees with all local towns and
factories, and soon protest marches with flags and balloons broke out. A
massive solidarity fund was created and the workers occupied their rail
workshops and sabotaged train tracks, also threatening to block major
rail routes. Several workshops were the only factories in the country
capable of producing breaks for cargo trains. Workers hung red flags
from their houses and occupied workplaces.

## Results

The strike was successful and no workers were laid off.
