**Redneck Revolt** is an
[anarcho-communist](Anarcho-Communism.md "wikilink") and
[anti-fascist](Anti-Fascism.md "wikilink") [network of gun
clubs](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Organizations.md "wikilink") and
[mutual aid](Mutual_Aid.md "wikilink") groups based in the Southern [United
States](United_States_of_America.md "wikilink") that specialises in
training people in safe firearm usage, first aid and gardening. They
also help provide [food](food.md "wikilink"), clothing and needle exchanges
to poor communities.

## History

### Precursor Organisations

Redneck Revolt was founded in 2009, in part in response to the perceived
contradictions of the Tea Party movement, as an offshoot of the **John
Brown Gun Club**, a firearms training and community defense project that
was itself founded in Lawrence, Kansas in 2004. Founding member Dave
Strano was previously part of the Kansas Mutual Aid Network, which was
involved in organizing protests against the Republican National
Convention in 2004, in relation to which he and others began to train
with firearms and engage in Second Amendment advocacy. In the early
2000s, John Brown Gun Club members operated anti-racist stalls at gun
shows in Kansas. The John Brown Gun Club sought to "demystify" firearms,
and to distinguish their commitment to community self-defense from
clandestine groups that advocated guerrilla warfare. Its first major
mobilization was a protest against the 2005 national conference of the
Minuteman Project.

### Name

The group attributes their use of the word "redneck" to the time of the
[Coal Wars](Coal_Wars_(USA).md "wikilink"), a series of labor disputes in
the United States occurring from around [1890 to around
1930](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_North_America.md "wikilink"),
when the word became popular among coalminers. The use of the term is
also intended as a form of subversion or reappropriation. The group's
name also refers to the [Battle of Blair
Mountain](Battle_of_Blair_Mountain.md "wikilink"), and the red bandanas
worn by members emulate those worn by striking coalminers during that
conflict. A member has said that the group tries "to acknowledge the
ways we've made mistakes and bought into [white
supremacy](White_Supremacy.md "wikilink") and
[capitalism](capitalism.md "wikilink"), but also give ourselves an
environment in which it's OK to celebrate redneck culture".
