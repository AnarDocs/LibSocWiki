**North Korea,** officially the **People's Democratic Republic of
Korea** or **DPRK** is a small country in Northeast Asia near [South
Korea](South_Korea.md "wikilink"), [China](China.md "wikilink"),
[Russia](Russia.md "wikilink") and [Japan](Japan.md "wikilink"). The country
is the subject of extreme controversy, commonly considered by
[liberals](Liberalism.md "wikilink") to be the worst example of
totalitarianism in the world. Whilst defended by some
[Marxist-Leninists](Marxist-Leninism.md "wikilink") as a direct democracy
that is constantly slandered by lying media and academics in the west.
