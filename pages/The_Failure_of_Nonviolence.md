From an analysis of these 38 different uprisings, four conclusions were
drawn.

1.  Movements that use a diversity of tactics are overwhelmingly more
    effective at seizing and defending space, and using that autonomy to
    put new social relations into practice, whether through practices of
    self-organization, collective self-defense, the reanimation of
    indigenous ways of life, or collectivization and
    [communization](communization.md "wikilink") (ending the alienation of
    capitalist property, which dictates that everything an be bought and
    sold, and putting our resources in common in a spirit of mutual aid
    rather than profit).
2.  Movements that use a diversity of tactics are more likely to spread,
    to inspire other people to take action, and they are much more
    likely than nonviolent movements to spread radical ideas and social
    critiques, whereas the majority of nonviolent movements are
    connected to populist complaints and watered-down slogans either
    lacking in social content or relying on the same social analysis
    disseminated by the mass media.
3.  Nonviolent movements are exponentially more likely to receive
    substantial elite support. The primary case in which combative
    movements receive elite support is when they crop up in opposition
    to governments that are at odds with ruling states (as when NATO
    will support people rebelling against the Libyan government).
4.  Excluding the achievement of free elections, which both combative
    and peaceful movements have proven effective at winning, movements
    that use a diversity of tactics have a better track record of
    achieving concrete gains.
