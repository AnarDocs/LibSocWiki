**"Why are you against the system?"** is a [frequently asked
question](Introduction_to_Libertarian_Socialism#FAQ.md "wikilink") often
given to [libertarian socialists](Libertarian_Socialism.md "wikilink").

## The Answer

People become libertarian socialists for a variety of reasons, but in
general, we believe that the current system (the
[state](State_(Polity).md "wikilink") +
[capitalism](capitalism.md "wikilink") + [bigotry](bigotry.md "wikilink"))
cannot go on forever or isn't the best way to manage the system. We
generally argue that these systems lead to an unnecessarily large amount
of [wars](War.md "wikilink"), [poverty](poverty.md "wikilink"),
[pollution](Ecocide.md "wikilink") and [unhappiness](Happiness.md "wikilink").
