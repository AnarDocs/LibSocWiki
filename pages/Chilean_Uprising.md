The **Chilean Uprising** is an ongoing uprising against the government
of [Chile](Chile.md "wikilink") that began in [October
2019](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_South_America.md "wikilink"), it
is considered a part of the [Latin American
Spring](Latin_American_Spring.md "wikilink"). Triggered by anger at
[neoliberalism](neoliberalism.md "wikilink"), privatisation,
[inequality](Economic_Inequality.md "wikilink") and high cost of living. It
has been considered the worst case of civil unrest in Chile since the
fall of Pinochet.

## Background

Following the fall of the [Pinochet
Dictatorship](Pinochet_Dictatorship.md "wikilink"), Chile has enjoyed a
stable period of [liberal
democracy](Representative_Democracy.md "wikilink") (with the exception of
the [Mapuche Uprising](Mapuche_Uprising_(1997).md "wikilink")). However,
the neoliberal economic policies of the government and leftist culture
leftover from the Allende years and resistance movements has created an
angry working class. After an increase in the cost of the Santiago
Metro's subway fare, protests began.

## Events

The protests began in Santiago on the 14th of October as a coordinated
fare evasion campaign by high school students which led to spontaneous
takeovers of the city's main train stations and open confrontations with
the police. The situation escalated On the 18th of October, the
situation escalated as a group of people began vandalizing city's
infrastructure; seizing, vandalizing, and burning down many stations of
the Santiago Metro network and disabling them with extensive
infrastructure damage, and for a time causing the cessation of the
network in its entirety. 81 stations have sustained major damage,
including 17 burned down. This led to a state of emergency and curfew
being declared in Santiago, with the military deployed to calm down
protests.

In the following days, the uprising has expanded to other cities and
towns, this escalated into a decentralised revolt which saw the burning
of buses and supermarkets, lootings and attacks on police. On the 6th of
January 2020, university exams were canceled and students blocked access
to test sites and burnt exam papers. Information about the unrest is
constantly changing, and dozens of people have died and been sexually
abused by police. The uprising is currently on hold due to the
[Coronavirus Pandemic](Coronavirus_Pandemic.md "wikilink").

## Results

The uprising has led to promises for reform a new referendum on the
Chilean constitution.
