## Healthcare in a Libertarian Socialist Society

[Libertarian socialists](Libertarian_Socialism.md "wikilink") have
experimented with various forms of healthcare in their
[communities](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Societies.md "wikilink").

### Zapatistas

The [Zapatistas](Rebel_Zapatista_Autonomous_Municipalities.md "wikilink")
maintain a high-quality universal healthcare service which has been
praised by the World Health Organization for reducing infant mortality
and providing strong primary care to residents.[^1] Residents of the
Zapatista communities believe their health services are better staffed,
equipped and less racist towards indigenous people than most services in
Chiapas. It also works with surrounding hospitals and freely takes in
patients from other communities who need to use the medical facilities
that only the Zapatistas have.[^2] Since 1994, the Zapatistas have built
2 new hospitals and 18 health clinics in the region to increase the
well-being of communities.[^3] According to one account of Oventic from
2016:

> In Oventic, there was a small yet seemingly fully-functional medical
> clinic, which appeared to offer basic healthcare. A sign on the door
> said general consultations, gynecology, optometry and laboratory
> services were all available five days a week. Emergency services were
> available 24 hours, seven days a week. They appeared to have a shiny
> new ambulance at their disposal. Other services offered a few days a
> week included dentistry and ultrasounds.[^4]
