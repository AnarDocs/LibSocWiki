The **Gezi Park Uprising** or **Gezi Park Protests** was an
[uprising](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Revolutions "wikilink") in
[Turkey](Republic_of_Turkey "wikilink") by
[environmentalists](Environmentalism "wikilink") to protect city parks
in [2013](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Western_Asia "wikilink").
This uprising helped create the [Gezi Park
Commune](Gezi_Park_Commune "wikilink").

## Background

In Istanbul (the capital and largest city in Turkey) the local
government was aggressively pursuing development policies and building
many new things to attract investors. This destroyed many green,
cultural and historical sites and pushed up rents and prices for most of
the population. When it was announced that they planned to tear down
Gezi Park - the largest green space in the city - to make way for a new
shopping center and luxury apartments, many people were outraged.[^1]

## Events

Spread out over several weeks, the Gezi Park Uprising saw people in
major cities battle [police](police "wikilink") with rocks, improvised
barricades in city streets and [molotovs](Molotov_Cocktail "wikilink"),
often driving them out of buildings and streets. In response, police
used tear gas, rubber bullets, pepper spray and occasionally ran over
protesters. There were also anti-protest mobs who attacked protesters
with baseball bats and wooden planks. Protesters burned down several
police stations, government buildings and businesses to express their
frustration.The riots largely subsided when the government reversed its
decisions to destroy the parks and forests, despite saying they wouldn't
listen to the protesters at first.[^2]

## Results

The movement succeeded in ending the destruction of a city park and
several rural forests. The movement also opened up more opportunities
for queer people and ethnic minorities. The major football club Car≈üi
reached out to a major LGBT organization and apologized for its prior
use of sexist and homophobic chants.The Pride march and the Trans march
in Istanbul that June were larger than they had ever been in the past,
as queer people felt more comfortable openly expressing themselves after
the protests.[^3]
