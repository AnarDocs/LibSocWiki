The **Francoist Dictatorship** or *Francoist Spain* was the
authoritarian, catholic, semi-[fascist](Fascism "wikilink") right-wing
dictatorship that ran [Spain](Spain "wikilink") from 1939 to 1975. It is
named after Francisco Franco, a general turned dictator of Spain who won
the [Spanish Civil War](Spanish_Civil_War "wikilink") and ran Spain
until his death in 1975. Francoist Spain was backed by the West during
the Cold War as the regime was anti-communist, being admitted into the
United Nations in the 1950's.

## History

### Isolation

Born out of the victorious
[Nationalist](Nationalists_(Spanish_Civil_War) "wikilink") faction of
the Spanish Civil War, the Francoists took power over a devastated
Spain. Gold and foreign exchange reserves had been virtually wiped out,
the massive devastation of war had reduced the productive capacity of
both industry and [agriculture](agriculture "wikilink"). To compound the
difficulties, even if the wherewithal had existed to purchase imports,
the outbreak of World War II rendered many needed supplies unavailable.
The end of the war did not improve Spain's plight because of subsequent
global shortages of raw materials, and peacetime industrial products.
After [World War II](World_War_II "wikilink"), Spain was denied Marshall
Plan aid for their closeness to [Fascist
Italy](Fascist_Italy "wikilink") and [Nazi
Germany](Nazi_Germany "wikilink"). Thus, Francoist Spain spent the first
decade of its existence diplomatically isolated, economically depressed
and fighting off the remaining [Republican
insurgents](Spanish_Maquis "wikilink").

### Entering the Cold War

Spain began to warm up to France and Britain in 1948, and developed a
close relationship with the US in 1950 as the US re-established
diplomatic relations with Spain, and in 1953 a formal alliance was
declared and soon the US began constructing several (still operational)
military bases in Spain. Despite it being a fascist ally of Nazi Germany
that engaged in horrific atrocities against its citizens and restricting
free speech, the [US was fine with allying with
it](Timeline_of_US_Imperialism "wikilink").

### Spanish Miracle

From 1959 to 1974, Spain became an economic miracle, it enjoyed the
second highest growth rate in the world, only slightly behind
[Japan](Japan "wikilink") and became the ninth largest economy in the
world, just behind [Canada](Canada "wikilink"). In 1946 there were
72,000 private cars in Spain, in 1966 there were over 1 million. This
growth rate had no equal in the world. The economic boom had three main
factors:

- Political stability
- Protectionist policies
- State-ownership of key industries in shipbuilding, car manufacturing,
  petrochemical, textiles

### Fall of the Dictatorship

Despite the economic boom, numerous leftist (most
[anarchist](Anarchism "wikilink"))
[guerilla](Guerilla_Warfare "wikilink") groups began to emerge all over
Spain, they are listed here by their year of founding:
