### Arrest

The rest of the group was executed, but Sascha was sentenced to life in
prison on account of his youth and he was placed in a Moscow dungeon.

nicer Yaroslavl prison. His left arm was shot while trying to escape,
resulting in its amputation.After an attempted suicide, he spent the
year 1914 in solitary confinement.
