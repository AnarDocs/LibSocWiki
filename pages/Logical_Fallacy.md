**Logical Fallacies** are 'errors' in the [logic](logic "wikilink") in
an [argument](Argument_(Philosophy) "wikilink") that undermine the
argument itself.

## List of Logical Fallacies

### Formal Fallacies

- Appeal to Probability - An argument that assumes something will happen
  because there is a chance that it will.
- Fallacy Fallacy - Concluding that an argument is false because it
  contains a logical fallacy.

### Informal Fallacies

- Ad Hominem - An argument based on a personal attack of the person
  making the argument rather than the argument itself.
- Appeal to the Stone - Dismissing a claim as absurd or foolish without
  explanation.
- Strawman - An argument based on misrepresenting another argument.
