**Logical Fallacies** are 'errors' in the [logic](logic.md "wikilink") in
an [argument](Argument_(Philosophy).md "wikilink") that undermine the
argument itself.

## List of Logical Fallacies

### Formal Fallacies

  because there is a chance that it will.
- Fallacy Fallacy - Concluding that an argument is false because it
  contains a logical fallacy.

### Informal Fallacies

- Ad Hominem - An argument based on a personal attack of the person
  making the argument rather than the argument itself.
- Appeal to the Stone - Dismissing a claim as absurd or foolish without
  explanation.
