**Björn Mikael Söderberg**(1958 - 1999) was an
[anarcho-syndicalist](Anarcho-Syndicalism "wikilink") and
[anti-fascist](Anti-Fascism "wikilink") activist associated with the
[SAC](Central_Organisation_of_the_Workers_of_Sweden "wikilink") in
[Sweden](Sweden "wikilink"). In 1999, Björn was murdered by three
[neo-nazis](Fascism "wikilink") who broke into his house and shot him
several times, including in the head. This resulted in massive
anti-fascist protests across Sweden (led by the SAC) and the creation of
a yearly award for activists across Sweden.[^1]
