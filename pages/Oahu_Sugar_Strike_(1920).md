The **Oahu Sugar Strike** was a multiracial
[strike](List_of_Strikes.md "wikilink") in
[1920](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_North_America.md "wikilink")
mainly by [Filipino](Philippines.md "wikilink") and
[Japanese](Japan.md "wikilink") migrant workers on sugarcane plantations in
[Hawaii](Hawaii.md "wikilink"), [USA](United_States_of_America.md "wikilink").
It involved 8,300 workers and was part of the [revolutionary
wave](Revolutions_of_1916_-_1923.md "wikilink") following [World War
I](World_War_I.md "wikilink").

## Background

There had been numerous strikes before against the fairly low wages paid
by the work there and the crowded living quarters for workers (which
during the strike suffered a [Spanish Flu](Spanish_Flu.md "wikilink")
outbreak killing 150 people). However, these strikes were often broken
as the plantation owners simply hired strikebreakers of other
ethnicities and playing on [racism](racism.md "wikilink").

[World War I](World_War_I.md "wikilink") led to an increase in living
expenses despite stagnant wages and was a period of organising for the
Filipino Labor Union and Federation of Japanese Labor, which brought a
series of demands to the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association on the 4th
of December, 1919 with a demand for a 38% wage increase for men and a
35% wage increase for women with paid maternity leave. The demands were
refused and a strike began.

## Events

In retaliation for the strike workers and their families were evicted
from their living quarters (12,020 people were evicted) leading to
strike sympathisers letting strikers stay in their homes as well as in
tent cities, hotels, empty buildings and churches (notably opposed by
Christian churches but supported by Buddhist and Shinto churches).
Boredom and low funds were major issues for the strike.

## Conclusion

The strike lasted until the 1st of July when a 50% pay raise with
benefits was granted to the strikers.
