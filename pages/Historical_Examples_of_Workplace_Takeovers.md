### Australia

In Northern Queensland from
[1908](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Oceania "wikilink") to
[1920](Timeline_of_the_IWW "wikilink"), the
[IWW](Industrial_Workers_of_the_World "wikilink") and the Australasian
Meat Industry Employees Union organized a degree of workers' control
among meat industry workers. From 1970 to 1980, Australia saw a massive
wave of workers' control corresponding with strikes all over the country
(Some authors have also argued that the [green
bans](Green_Bans "wikilink") (1970 - 1977) constitute a form of workers'
control) Including:
