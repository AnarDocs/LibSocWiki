The **Iron Law of Oligarchy** is an idea in
[sociology](sociology.md "wikilink") that suggests all [democratic
organisations](Democracy.md "wikilink") eventually turn into oligarchies.
Developed by [Syndicalist](Syndicalism.md "wikilink") [Robert
Michels](Robert_Michels.md "wikilink") and is often used as one of the
strongest arguments against democracy, especially [representative
democracy](Representative_Democracy.md "wikilink").

## Overview

According to the theory all organizations eventually come to be run by a
"leadership class", who often function as paid administrators,
executives, spokespersons or political strategists for the organization.
Far from being "servants of the masses", Michels argues this "leadership
class," rather than the organization's membership, will inevitably grow
to dominate the organization's power structures. By controlling who has
access to information, those in power can centralize their power
successfully, often with little accountability, due to the apathy,
indifference and non-participation most rank and file members have in
relation to their organization's decision-making processes.

It is argued that democratic attempts to hold leadership positions
accountable are prone to fail, since with power comes the ability to
reward loyalty, the ability to control information about the
organization, and the ability to control what procedures the
organization follows when making decisions. All of these mechanisms can
be used to strongly influence the outcome of any decisions made
'democratically' by members.

The "iron law of oligarchy" states that all forms of organization,
regardless of how democratic they may be at the start, will eventually
and inevitably develop oligarchic tendencies, thus making true democracy
practically and theoretically impossible, especially in large groups and
complex organizations. The relative structural fluidity in a small-scale
democracy succumbs to "social viscosity" in a large-scale organization.
According to the "iron law," democracy and large-scale organization are
incompatible.

## Evidence

### Political Parties

Two of the most well studied examples include the German Social
Democratic Party and the German Green Party.

### Trade Unions

### Student Unions

### Wikipedia

One study in 2016 of he evolution of Wikipedia's network of norms over
time found that it is consistent with the iron law of oligarchy. Their
quantitative analysis is based on data-mining over a decade of article
and user information. It shows the emergence of an oligarchy derived
from competencies in five significant "clusters": administration,
article quality, collaboration, formatting, and content policy. The
study noted, "The encyclopedia’s core norms address universal
principles, such as neutrality, verifiability, civility, and consensus.
The ambiguity and interpretability of these abstract concepts may drive
them to decouple from each other over time."[^1] This view conflicts
with the view proposed by [some](Anarchy_Works.md "wikilink") that
Wikipedia is democratic and self-improving, but the lack of formal
hierarchies in Wikipedia and commitment to certain ideals prevent a
fixed hierarchy and keeps Wikipedia open-source.

## Breaking the Law

It is possible to break the law and preserve democratic institutions
from becoming oligarchical. [Adolf Gasser](Adolf_Gasser.md "wikilink")
argued that if you met five conditions, you could break the iron law of
oligarchy and preserve democratic institutions:

1.  Society has to be built up from bottom to top. As a consequence,
    society is built up by people, who are free and have the power to
    defend themselves with weapons.
2.  These free people join or form local communities. These local
    communities are independent, which includes financial independence,
    and they are free to determine their own rules.
3.  Local communities join together into a higher unit e.g. a canton.
4.  There is no hierarchical bureaucracy.
5.  There is competition between these local communities e.g. on
    services delivered or on taxes.

This approach strongly resembles the model of confederation proposed by
libertarian socialists. In Seymour Martin Lipset's
[study](Union_Democracy_(Book).md "wikilink") of the International
Typographical Union in 1956, found that two factors in the union allowed
for it to break the iron law of oligarchy:
