**Political Repression in the USA** refers to the various ways the
[United States](United_States_of_America "wikilink") government has
undermined various movements that threaten it. Like most liberal
democracies, the United States has never really had a campaign of overt
banning and mass murder to repress political opponents. Instead,
political repression takes far more quiet and subtle forms involving
assassinations, strategy of tension, imprisonment of activists on
false/exaggerated charges, monitoring, encouraging of suicides and the
occasional massacre.
