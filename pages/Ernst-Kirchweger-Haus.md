**Ernst-Kirchweger-Haus** or **EKH** is a [social
center](Social_Center.md "wikilink") and [former
squat](List_of_Squats.md "wikilink") (between [1990 and
2008](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Western_Europe.md "wikilink"))
in Vienna, [Austria](Republic_of_Austria.md "wikilink").

## History

The building had been constructed in 1931 as a school for the children
of Czech and Slovak immigrants to Vienna, becoming property of the
Communist Party of Austria in 1945. It was eventually unused and
neglected, and became occupied by squatters in 1990 who named it after
the communist and [anti-fascist](Anti-Fascism.md "wikilink") martyr Ernst
Kirchweger, who was murdered during a protest of a Nazi public speaker
in 1965.

In 2004, the [Communist Party of
Austria](Communist_Party_of_Austria.md "wikilink") attempted to sell the
building to a real estate company who's managing director who had been
accused of links to local far-right and neo-nazis groups in the area,
such as the Neue Rechte. This sparked massive protests by the squatters
and their supporters which prevented the sale of the building,
eventually allowing them to become paying tenants in 2008.

In 2013, 30 [Neo-Nazis](Neo-Nazism.md "wikilink") from the 'Immortal
Vienna' stormed the house and beat a local communist, leading to a fight
in the house. In 2016, far-right [Turkish
Nationalists](Turkish_Nationalism.md "wikilink") stormed the house to
disrupt the celebration of a Serbian society, believing it was a
[Kurdish](Kurds.md "wikilink") event, lighting fires and tearing up posters
before being kicked out.[^1]
