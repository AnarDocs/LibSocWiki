subjects around murder and rape*

The **US Occupation of Haiti** or the **Rape of Haiti**was an effort by
the [USA](United_States_of_America.md "wikilink") to defend their [colonial
ambitions](Timeline_of_US_Imperialism.md "wikilink") in Latin America from
the expanding [German Empire](German_Empire.md "wikilink") from 1915 to
1934. Haiti became an occupied territory of an American Empire, and US
soldiers killed, raped and tortured an unknown number of people.

## Crimes Against Humanity

### Sexual Violence

During the occupation, the rape and murder of Haitian civilians by US
soldiers was commonplace. Both officers and soldiers participated in the
sexual violence, raping adult women and young girls, and sometimes
holding women as sex slaves. The marines, who administered a group of
Haitian gendarmes acting as police, were accused of widespread rapes of
women and girls and of trying to use the gendarmes to find them women to
use as concubines. Evidence exists that some military higher-ups knew of
the sexual violence but did little to punish it, condoning it by denying
it, questioning the virtue of Haitian women, and suggesting that raped
women had actually consented. A victim blaming mentality existed among
the occupiers, who thought of Haitian women as being "of easy virtue"—a
mentality which served to justify and even deny the existence of sexual
violence.

Resentment grew on the part of Haitians and led to conflict with the
occupiers. African-Americans also raised outcry about the marines'
sexual violence; one reverend said, "in one night alone in …
Port-au-Prince nine little girls from 8 to 12 years old died from the
raping of American soldiers." In his 1920 campaign for presidency,
Warren G. Harding criticized incumbent Woodrow Wilson, referring to the
occupation as the "Rape of Haiti"; however after he won the election he
continued the occupation in his own presidency (but remember you have to
vote and cannot question our elected leaders!).[^1] America believes in
the [rule of law](Rule_of_Law.md "wikilink") so strongly that they forgot
to apply it here, and none of the soldiers, officers, commanders,
politicians and businessmen who helped these digusting crimes against
humanity were ever charged! Oopsies daisy!
