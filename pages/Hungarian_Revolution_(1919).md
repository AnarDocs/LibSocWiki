The **Hungarian Revolution of 1919** refers to a [socialist
revolution](List_of_Revolutions "wikilink") that took place in
[Hungary](Hungary "wikilink") in
[1919](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Eastern_Europe "wikilink").
It led to the formation of the **Hungarian Soviet Republic** (or the
**Republic of Councils in Hungary**) which became the second [socialist
state](Socialism_in_Practice "wikilink") established in the world, and
was given direct orders by [Lenin](Vladimir_Lenin "wikilink").

## Background

Following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after World War I,
a new liberal republic was established. However, the government lacked a
military and had its land occupied by foreign powers. The Hungarian
Communist Party organised itself in a hotel in Moscow, and returned to
Hungary, recruiting unemployed soldiers, young intellectuals, ethnic
minorities and urban industrial workers.

After attempted repression of the movement and street battles with the
social democrats, the government attempted to merge with the social
democrats to form the Hungarian Socialist Party. After many communists
were released from prisons, they carried out a coup against the liberal
government and purged social democrats from the government.

### Socialist Policies

The policies implemented by the government included:

- Abolition of all aristocratic titles and privileges
- Sepeartion of church and state
- Right to freedom of speech and assembly
- Free education
- Language and cultural rights for minorities
- Nationalisation of industry, banks, transport, housing, healthcare,
  cultural institutions and large landholdings

In addition, there was the creation of the Lenin Boys, a militia which
was deployed in locations where it was suspected a counter-revolution
would begin. They began a [red terror](Red_Terror_(Hungary) "wikilink"),
executing people without trial and disbanding religious ceremonies,
which led to them being attacked by locals. The red terror soon spread
to the cities after a failed coup by the [social
democrats](Social_Democracy "wikilink"), in which people were executed
for suspected involvement with the coup, leading to a loss of support
for the government.

The government attempted to form an alliance with socialist Russia, but
Lenin refused, citing the need to concentrate on the [Russian Civil
War](Russian_Civil_War "wikilink"), but he still issued commands to them
via radio.

### Downfall

The government had sustained popularity by promising to regain Hungary's
borders, but soon this failed and the army defected. Then, Romania
invaded, destroyed the revolution and began a white terror.

## Aftermath

Surviving organisers fled to what would become the
[USSR](USSR "wikilink") and were later all killed during the Great
Purge.

### Legacy

Both the [Hungarian People's
Republic](Hungarian_People's_Republic "wikilink") and [1956
revolution](Hungarian_Revolution_(1956) "wikilink") claimed to be the
legitimate successors of this revolution.
