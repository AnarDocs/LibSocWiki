**The Civic Crusade**in [Panama](Panama "wikilink") was a movement
against the[dictatorship of Manuel
Noriega](Noriega_Dictatorship "wikilink") from
[1987](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Central_America "wikilink")
to [1989](Revolutions_of_1989_-_1992 "wikilink").

## Background

Panama's military dictatorship began in 1968 when [Omar
Torrijos](Torrijos_Dictatorship "wikilink"), a populist general, led a
coup and against the democratic government and promoted a mixture of
populist and nationalist policies. Although he repressed dissent, he did
create a plan for allowing municipal elections in 1980 and presidential
elections in 1981. However, he was killed (likely assassinated) in a
plane crash in 1981, and the subsequent elections were tainted by
widespread allegations of fraud and soon General Manuel Noriega took
power by force. Noriega's dictatorship worked with the
[CIA](CIA "wikilink") in the [Contra
War](Contra_War_(Nicaragua) "wikilink") in Nicaragua, engaged in drug
trafficking, was deeply corrupted and kidnapped, tortured and often
killed dissenters.

## Events

At first, the family of dissenter Dr. Huge Spadatora organised small
protests and religious observances in protest, but these quickly faded.
However, in June 1987, Noriega forcibly retired his Chief of Staff, who
became an outspoken opponent of the regime accusing Noriego of
assassinating Torrijos, electoral fraud, drug trafficking and selling
visas to [Cuban exiles](Cuban_Exiles "wikilink"). Discontent grew and
the National Civic Crusade (CCN) was created by various businesses,
trade unions and activist groups. They organised several [capital
strikes](Capital_Strike "wikilink") and daily protests were held despite
the government killing several protesters.

As the demonstrations spread, the government responded by declaring a
state of emergency, suspending constitutional rights, and instituting
censorship. The government threatened to arrest those involved in the
protests and seize the property of businesses that joined in the strike,
closed the schools and [universities](University "wikilink"), and
unleashed a virulent propaganda campaign accusing its opponents of being
linked with [United States
interests](Timeline_of_US_Imperialism "wikilink") that wanted to abort
the [Panama Canal](Panama_Canal "wikilink") treaties. Soon the Catholic
church joined in criticising the government but refused to formally
endorse the CCN. Periodic protests, strikes, and demonstrations
continued throughout the second half of 1987. Besides the CCN, many
labor unions, womenâ€™s associations, and medical associations also staged
protests. Relations with the USA deteriorated rapidly as the government
charged the US embassy with supporting the opposition An attack on the
embassy by a mob and the arrest of United States diplomatic and military
personnel by the government led to a suspension of military assistance
and increased economic sanctions by the United States. The CCN attempted
to organise elections in [1989](Revolutions_of_1989_-_1992 "wikilink")
and they were shut down by Noriega who soon declared war on the USA,
leading to a [US invasion](US_Invasion_of_Panama_(1989) "wikilink")
which halted the movement.[^1]

## Results

Although the movement was cut short by the US invasion, it is notable
that after the invasion, Panama has held free elections since, is
considered to be the eighth most democratic country in the Americas
(after [Canada](Canada "wikilink"), [Uruguay](Uruguay "wikilink"),
[Costa Rica](Costa_Rica "wikilink"), [Chile](Chile "wikilink"),
[USA](United_States_of_America "wikilink"), [Trinidad and
Tobago](Trinidad_and_Tobago "wikilink") and
[Colombia](Colombia "wikilink"))[^2], scores high on human
development[^3] and has abolished its military.
