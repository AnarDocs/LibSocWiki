The **Mount Isa Mines Strike**was a [strike](List_of_Strikes "wikilink")
at Mount Isa, [Australia](Commonwealth_of_Australia "wikilink") from
[1964 to 1965](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Oceania "wikilink").
Although starting as a simple dispute over wages, it quickly turned into
a complex struggle for control of [trade
unions](Trade_Union "wikilink"), being a contest for control of the mine
either by the [IWW](Industrial_Workers_of_the_World "wikilink"),
[communist-controlled unions](Authoritarian_Socialism "wikilink"),
[liberal unions](Liberalism "wikilink") and the desire of the mining
corporation to have little union influence at all.

## Background

At the time, Mount Isa Mines was one of the largest
[mines](Mining "wikilink") in Australia, producing copper, zinc, lead
and silver. As it was a hugely-profitable operations and required many
workers, there had been unrest in the past over pay and bonuses
disputes, and the strike erupted when the mine rejected the unions push
for a \$4 an hour wage increase during collective bargaining
sessions.[^1]

## Events

The striking miners employed many tactics during the strike, notably [go
slows](Go_Slow "wikilink"). There had also been a car chase at some
point, killing an unknown individual. The miners were led by IWW member
[Pat Mackie](Pat_Mackie "wikilink"), who was born in New Zealand and
spoke with an American accent, leading the news to say that he was a
foreign agent trying to make it easy for China to invade Australia. He
was eventually expelled from the [Australian Workers'
Union](Australian_Workers'_Union "wikilink") and fired from the site,
whilst local [police](police "wikilink") were given the power to search
houses without a warrant and seize strike materials.[^2]

## Results

The strike eventually resulted with the police loosing many of the legal
powers and the original demands of the strikers being met.[^3]
