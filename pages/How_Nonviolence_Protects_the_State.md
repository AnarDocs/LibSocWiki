**How Nonviolence Protects the State** is a 2005
[book](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Media.md "wikilink") by [Peter
Gelderloos](Peter_Gelderloos.md "wikilink") which challenges the perception
that [strict nonviolence](Pacifism.md "wikilink") is the best way to
[change the world](Revolution.md "wikilink"), as opposed to a [diversity of
tactics](Diversity_of_Tactics.md "wikilink"). The book is also heavily
critical of nonviolence for being "wrapped in authoritarian dynamics,
and its results are harnessed to meet government objectives over popular
objectives. It masks and even encourages
[patriarchal](Patriarchy.md "wikilink") assumptions and power dynamics. Its
strategic options invariably lead to dead ends. And its practitioners
delude themselves on a number of key points."

## Summary

### Nonviolence is Ineffective

Nonviolent activists like to claim the success of the Indian
independence movement, the civil rights movement, the cap on nuclear
weapons, the anti-war movement during the Vietnam war and the 2003
anti-war protests as excellent examples of nonviolence bringing about
massive changes in society. But a closer examination reveals all of
these successes to be overstated and whitewashed by nonviolent
activists.

Indian independence only really occurred following the [Second World
War](World_War_II.md "wikilink") and armed resistance by Jewish and Arab
militants in Palestine. Furthermore, Indian revolutionaries such as
[Bhagat Singh](Bhagat_Singh.md "wikilink") and [Chandra Shekhar
Azad](Chandra_Shekhar_Azad.md "wikilink") frequently endorsed
assassinations and bombings while being hugely popular. Furthermore,
India was never really granted independence, quickly being taken over by
[multinational corporations](Corporation.md "wikilink") run by much of the
Global North, and Britain hand-picked the new government, whilst fanning
the flames of ethnic hatred to destabilize the country.

The [anti-nuclear movement](Anti-Nuclear_Movement.md "wikilink") was again
not exclusively nonviolent, with groups like [Direct
Action](Direct_Action_(Canada).md "wikilink") in
[Canada](Canada.md "wikilink") and guerillas like [Marco
Camenisch](Marco_Camenisch.md "wikilink") in Switzerland, and several major
nuclear accidents forced governments to reconsider its use. The US
[civil rights movement](Civil_Rights_Movement.md "wikilink") did not
entirely succeed, as people of colour still have to deal with lower
wages, worse housing and healthcare in a form of de facto segregation.
During the 1960s and 1970s, armed groups like the [Black
Panthers](Black_Panthers.md "wikilink") and people like [Malcolm
X](Malcolm_X.md "wikilink") had greater support than pacifists, a fact
which has been covered up by governments, schools and charities.
Nonviolent movements by [MLK](Martin_Luther_King_Jr..md "wikilink") had
largely failed, and it was only during violent moments like the
[Birmingham Uprising](1963_Birmingham_Uprising.md "wikilink"), when
revolution looked like an imminent possibility, that the government
began to legislate legal equality for African Americans.

The anti-war movement against the Vietnam War saw violence in numerous
areas. Soldiers frequently assassinated their commanding officers fire
stabbing, shooting, explosions and sometimes openly mutinied. Back home,
civilians began to bomb and burn down military facilities and corporate
assets that gained from the war. The purely nonviolent protests in 2003
against the Iraq War completely failed to stop the invasion or even
hinder the ability of the US military to act, with the notable exception
of the 2004 Madrid Train Station bombings in Spain (although this was
committed by a far-right group which must be fought).

Pacifism's failure also flares up in [World War
II](World_War_II.md "wikilink"), where the Jewish community in Germany and
Poland pursued a strategy of nonviolent resistance to the Nazis from
1933 and 1942 which completely failed to prevent the
[Holocaust](Holocaust.md "wikilink"), which only began to slow down with
armed resistance (assassinations, bombing and arsons) like the
[Auschwitz](Auschwitz#Uprising.md "wikilink") and [Warsaw
Uprisings](1944_Warsaw_Uprising.md "wikilink"), which saved tens of
thousands of people from their death.

### Nonviolence is Racist

Given that nonviolence ignores the imminent need for racial justice and
equality, and how it argues that violent resistance is wrong. Indigenous
people, the descendants of slaves and refugees of war need to employ
violence as a matter of survival, and claiming that this is ineffective
or makes them just as bad as their oppressor is extremely dehumanizing.
Many famous non-white activists (like Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and MLK)
are tokenized by white pacifists, and their support for armed struggle
is extensively downplayed. The misrepresenting of prominent anti-racist
activists to suit your own agenda and denial of anti-racists choosing
their own path to liberation upholds white supremacist power structures.

### Nonviolence is Statist

Nonviolence ensures a [state](State_(Polity).md "wikilink") monopoly on
violence. States - the centralized bureaucracies that protect
[capitalism](capitalism.md "wikilink"); preserve a white supremacist,
patriarchal order; and implement imperialist expansion - survive by
assuming the role of the sole legitimate purveyor of violent force
within their territory. Any struggle against oppression necessitates a
conflict with the state. Pacifists do the state’s work by pacifying the
opposition in advance.

### Nonviolence is Patriarchal

Nonviolence completely ignores patriarchy (a system of dividing people
into two rigid gender roles, man and woman, and assigning men greater
power, to great harm to social health). Pacifists also frequently claim
that advocacy for armed struggle reinforces patriarchy, but this is
based of shoddy pseudoscience (about women being naturally nonviolent,
an idea that harms the feminist movement) and denial of feminist
history.

Various examples of explicitly feminist groups, uprisings or groups with
large female or queer membership which have rejected nonviolence and
embraced armed struggle include the [Nigerian Oil Platform
Occupations](Nigerian_Oil_Platform_Occupations.md "wikilink"),
[First](First_Intifada.md "wikilink") and [Second
Intifadas](Second_Intifada.md "wikilink") in Palestine, [Stonewall
Rebellion](Stonewall_Uprising.md "wikilink"),
[Vietcong](Vietcong.md "wikilink"), [Black Panther
Party](Black_Panther_Party.md "wikilink"), [Mujeres
Creando](Mujeres_Creando.md "wikilink"), the
[Zapatistas](Zapatista_Army_of_National_Liberation.md "wikilink"),
[Suffragettes](Suffragettes.md "wikilink"), [Weather
Underground](Weather_Underground.md "wikilink"), [Direct
Action](Direct_Action_(Canada).md "wikilink"), [Wimmin’s Fire
Brigade](Wimmin’s_Fire_Brigade.md "wikilink") and [Rote
Zora](Rote_Zora.md "wikilink").

Women and queer people who supported violent struggle include, [Laina
Tanglewood](Laina_Tanglewood.md "wikilink"), [Sue
Daniels](Sue_Daniels.md "wikilink"), [Elaine
Brown](Elaine_Brown.md "wikilink"), [Kathleen
Cleaver](Kathleen_Cleaver.md "wikilink"), [Frankye Malika
Adams](Frankye_Malika_Adams.md "wikilink"), [Sylvia
Rivera](Sylvia_Rivera.md "wikilink"), [Ann Hansen](Ann_Hansen.md "wikilink"),
[Emma Goldman](Emma_Goldman.md "wikilink"), [Mollie
Steimer](Mollie_Steimer.md "wikilink") and [Anna Mae
Pictou-Aquash](Anna_Mae_Pictou-Aquash.md "wikilink"), one of 60 indigenous
american activists murdered by the
[FBI's](Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation.md "wikilink") paramilitaries in
the 1970s.

### Nonviolence is Tactically and Strategically Inferior

### Nonviolence is Deluded

### The Alternative: Possibilities for Revolutionary Activism

## Criticism

Despite being one of thhe most read and popular books in revolutionary
circles, the book has faced some strong criticism. In the article 'How
Nonviolence is Misrepresented' (read
[here](https://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/08gm2.html)), it is argued that the
book misrepresents nonviolence and fails to consider various debates and
theories in the pacifist community.
