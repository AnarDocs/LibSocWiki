The **Central Asian Revolt of 1916**, also called **Urkun** or the
**Semirechye Revolt** was an [uprising in
1916](Revolutions_of_1916_-_1923 "wikilink") of the mainly
[Muslim](Islam "wikilink")-inhabitants against the [Russian
Empire](Russian_Empire "wikilink") in what is now
[Kazakhstan](Kazakhstan "wikilink") and
[Kyrgyzstan](Kyrgyzstan "wikilink") which had attempted to conscript
them into fighting in [World War I](World_War_I "wikilink").

## Background

Following the abolition of serfdom in Russia by 1861 the area had been
stepped in poverty, inequality and religious tension. Redistribution of
Muslim land to non-muslims and [cossacks](cossacks "wikilink") caused
anger. By the time World War I rolled around, conscription was soon
introduced to the area for all people aged 19 to 43. Leading to Muslim
leaders to declare a holy war against the 'infidel' Russian government.

## Events

Initially, people just began to bribe military officers to exempt
themselves from military service. But eventually, an outraged mob of
protesters attacked government officials, leading to police shooting the
protesters. People began to attack government officials and police, and
soon the entire city of Tashkent was taken by rebels. The rebels listed
several demands including an end to discrimination in conscription, one
man to stay home and a delay of conscription until the end of the
harvest. Soon other cities were taken and the Russian army was deployed
as the rebels cut telephone lines, the rebels used spears and whips as
weapons during a shortage of guns.

Unfortunately, the rebels fell victim to anti-Russian and anti-Cossack
racism and began to kill them and burn down their houses. To ease the
rebellion the Russian Empire allowed for teaching in Kazakh and Kyrgyz
languages and allowing greater freedom of the press. But soon 30,000
soldiers armed with machine guns and artillery arrived to the region via
the train. The rebels fled to the mountains and either died of cold or
left the rebellion.

## Aftermath

Many Kyrygz people faced massive amounts of racism, [Alexander
Kerensky](Alexander_Kerensky "wikilink") said to the Russian Parliament:

> "How can we possibly blame a backward, uneducated and suppressed
> aboriginal people so dissimilar to us, for having lost patience and
> committing acts of revolt for which they immediately felt remorse and
> regret?"

Military courts were established in cities and all participants were
sentenced to death. Vigilante revenge killings by Russians affected by
the racism occured. Leading to tens of thousands of people fleeing to
China via the mountains, thousands dying in the mountain passes. 2,325
Russians died (with 1,384 going missing) and between 100,000 and 270,000
Kyrgyz were killed, amounting to 40% of the Kyrgyz population.

The rebellion inspired the [Basmachi
Movement](Basmachi_Movement "wikilink").

The rebellion was not taught in schools in the [USSR](USSR "wikilink")
and it was only recognised as a [genocide](genocide "wikilink") in 2016.
