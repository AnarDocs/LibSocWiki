**Representative democracy** (also **indirect democracy**,
**representative government** or **psephocracy**) is a type of
[democracy](democracy.md "wikilink") founded on the principle of elected
officials representing a group of people, as opposed to direct
democracy. These should not be confused with directly democratic
[libertarian socialist](Libertarian_Socialism.md "wikilink")
[confederations](Confederation.md "wikilink"), in which 'representative's
(called delegates for the sake of simplicity) are subject to recall,
short-terms and only represent a small interest.

## History

*See Also: [Timeline of Representative
Democracy](Timeline_of_Representative_Democracy.md "wikilink")*

The development of representative democracy has been a long and unstable
process, and that have been constant waves of representative governments
forming as well as backslides into more authoritarian governments.

### Precursors

Although numerous direct democracies have existed throughout history
([Ancient Athens](Athenian_Polis.md "wikilink"),
[Haudenosaunee](Haudenosaunee_Confederacy.md "wikilink"), possibly the
[Indus River Valley
Civilisation](Indus_River_Valley_Civilization.md "wikilink")) there are few
examples of representative democracies.

### First wave

The First wave of democracy, 1828â€“1926 began in the early 19th century
when suffrage was granted to the majority of white males in the United
States ("Jacksonian democracy"). Then came France, Britain, Canada,
Australia, Italy and Argentina, and a few others before 1900. At its
peak, after the breakup of the Russian, German, Austrian and Ottoman
empires in 1918, the first wave saw 29 democracies in the world.
Reversal began in 1922, when Benito Mussolini rose to power in Italy.
The collapse primarily hit newly formed democracies, which could not
stand against the aggressions rise of expansionist communist, fascist
and militaristic authoritarian or totalitarian movements which
systematically rejected democracy. The nadir of the first wave came in
1942, when the number of democracies in the world dropped to a mere
12.<sup>\[7\]\[8\]</sup>

### Second wave

The Second wave began following the Allied victory in World War II, and
crested nearly 20 years later in 1962 with 36 recognised democracies in
the world. The Second wave ebbed as well at this point, and the total
number dropped to 30 democracies between 1962 and the mid-1970s. But the
"flat line" would not last for long, as the third wave was about to
surge in a way no one had ever seen.<sup>\[4\]</sup>

Scholars have noted that the appearance of "waves" of democracy largely
disappears when women's suffrage is taken into account; moreover, some
countries change their positions quite dramatically: Switzerland, which
is typically included as part of the first wave, did not grant women the
right to vote until 1971.<sup>\[9\]</sup>

### Third wave

The Third wave began in 1974 (Carnation Revolution, Portugal) and
included the historic democratic transitions in Latin America in the
1980s, Asia Pacific countries (Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan)
from 1986 to 1988, Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Soviet
Union, and sub-Saharan Africa beginning in 1989. The expansion of
democracy in some regions was stunning. In Latin America only Colombia,
Costa Rica, and Venezuela were democratic by 1978 and only Cuba and
Haiti remained authoritarian by 1995, when the wave had swept across
twenty countries.<sup>\[10\]</sup>

Huntington points out that three-fourths of the new democracies were
Roman Catholics.<sup>\[11\]</sup> Most Protestant countries already were
democratic. He emphasizes the Vatican Council of 1962, which turned the
Catholic Church from defenders of the old established order into an
opponent of totalitarianism.<sup>\[12\]</sup>

Countries undergoing or having undergone a transition to democracy
during a wave are subject to democratic backsliding. Political
scientists and theorists believe that the third wave has crested and
will soon begin to ebb, just as its predecessors did in the first and
second waves.<sup>\[13\]</sup> Indeed, in the period immediately
following the onset of the "war on terror" after the September 11, 2001
attacks on the United States, some backsliding was evident. How
significant or lasting that erosion is remains a subject of
debate.<sup>\[*citation needed*\]</sup>

After the Great Recession of 2008, a number of countries backslid from
democracy including Thailand, Cambodia, Philippines, Turkey, Poland,
Hungary, Honduras and the Maldives. Some other countries have had
democratic transitions however, such as Tunisia and the Gambia. There
has also been limited democratic reform in some countries, such as Burma
and Morocco.

## Positives

### Quality of Life

### Peace

Representative democracies are significantly less likely to go to war
than dictatorships[^1] and are far less likely to repress their citizens
(and repression in democracies is significantly smaller) than
dictatorships. Additionally, democracies have significantly lower
violent crime rates. Although there are notably violent democracies
(notably [USA](United_States_of_America.md "wikilink"),
[Israel](Israel.md "wikilink"), [South Africa](South_Africa.md "wikilink") and
[Colombia](Colombia.md "wikilink")) and peaceful dictatorships there is an
incredibly strong relationship between democracy and peace. Of the 40
most peaceful countries on Earth, only 2 ([Qatar](Qatar.md "wikilink") and
[Bhutan](Bhutan.md "wikilink")) aren't democracies.

### Strength

Democracies are significantly more likely to win wars than dictatorship
(despite being far less likely to start them).
[Wikipedia](Wikipedia.md "wikilink") lists x wars between 1900 and 2019, x
have been wars between states, x have been coalition wars, x have been
rebellions/insurgencies against a state, x have been civil wars.

## Negatives

### Authoritarian Criticisms

Sociologist [Robert Michels](Robert_Michels.md "wikilink") argued that all
democratic institutions suffer from an [Iron Law of
Oligarchy](Iron_Law_of_Oligarchy.md "wikilink"), which states that power
tends to be concentrated over time in ANY democratic organisations,
effectively dooming democracy to always be a failure.
