The **National Confederation of Labour** or **Confederaci√≥n Nacional del
Trabajo** or **CNT**is a [confederation](confederation.md "wikilink") of
[anarcho-syndicalist](Anarcho-Syndicalism.md "wikilink") [trade
unions](Trade_Union.md "wikilink") across
[Spain](Kingdom_of_Spain.md "wikilink"), it is the largest and most
powerful [anarcho-syndicalist
organisation](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Organizations.md "wikilink") in
the world.

## History

### Founding

The CNT was founded in 1910 as a combination of the growth of
anarcho-syndicalism in Spain and many workers hostility to the socialist
UGT union. It was planned to be founded in 1909, but pushed back the
conference in response to massacres.

### Spanish Civil War

The CNT oversaw the collectivization of farmland, factories, railways,
docks, trams and the organisation of various militias.

### Repression and Survival

After the Spanish Civil War, the CNT was outlawed and its assets
expropriated by the new government. Roughly [180,000 members of the CNT
were executed by the government](White_Terror_(Spain).md "wikilink") during
[World War II](World_War_II.md "wikilink"), causing many members to flee
the country. Many CNT members lived in other countries in exile, and
others joined the [Spanish Maquis](Spanish_Maquis.md "wikilink") to fight
the new fascist government, or else others just stayed quiet. In 1960,
the Libertarian Movement in Exile (MLE) was formed by members of the
CNT, FAI and FIJL, holding a conference in Limoges, Southwest
[France](France.md "wikilink"). Anarcho-syndicalism was nearly destroyed as
a political force, but remained somewhat popular with non-fascist
catholics.[^1]
