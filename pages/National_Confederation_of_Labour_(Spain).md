*Not to be confused with the [National Confederation of Labour in
France](National_Confederation_of_Labour_(France) "wikilink")*

The **National Confederation of Labour** or **Confederaci√≥n Nacional del
Trabajo** or **CNT**is a [confederation](confederation "wikilink") of
[anarcho-syndicalist](Anarcho-Syndicalism "wikilink") [trade
unions](Trade_Union "wikilink") across
[Spain](Kingdom_of_Spain "wikilink"), it is the largest and most
powerful [anarcho-syndicalist
organisation](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Organizations "wikilink") in
the world.

## History

### Founding

The CNT was founded in 1910 as a combination of the growth of
anarcho-syndicalism in Spain and many workers hostility to the socialist
UGT union. It was planned to be founded in 1909, but pushed back the
conference in response to massacres.

### Spanish Civil War

The CNT oversaw the collectivization of farmland, factories, railways,
docks, trams and the organisation of various militias.

### Repression and Survival

After the Spanish Civil War, the CNT was outlawed and its assets
expropriated by the new government. Roughly [180,000 members of the CNT
were executed by the government](White_Terror_(Spain) "wikilink") during
[World War II](World_War_II "wikilink"), causing many members to flee
the country. Many CNT members lived in other countries in exile, and
others joined the [Spanish Maquis](Spanish_Maquis "wikilink") to fight
the new fascist government, or else others just stayed quiet. In 1960,
the Libertarian Movement in Exile (MLE) was formed by members of the
CNT, FAI and FIJL, holding a conference in Limoges, Southwest
[France](France "wikilink"). Anarcho-syndicalism was nearly destroyed as
a political force, but remained somewhat popular with non-fascist
catholics.[^1]
