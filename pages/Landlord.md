**Landlords** are people that own [housing](housing "wikilink") and
allow other people to temporarily live in them in exchange for
[rent](rent "wikilink"). Landlords are considered to represent one of
three ways someone can be a part of the
[bourgeoisie](Ruling_Class#Bourgeoisie "wikilink") (the other being
[bosses](Boss "wikilink") and bankers).
