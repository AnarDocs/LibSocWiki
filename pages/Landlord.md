**Landlords** are people that own [housing](housing.md "wikilink") and
allow other people to temporarily live in them in exchange for
[rent](rent.md "wikilink"). Landlords are considered to represent one of
three ways someone can be a part of the
[bourgeoisie](Ruling_Class#Bourgeoisie.md "wikilink") (the other being
[bosses](Boss.md "wikilink") and bankers).
