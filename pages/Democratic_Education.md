**Democratic Education**or **Democratic Schooling** is a method of
[education](education "wikilink") which stresses the needs of the
[student](student "wikilink") as an autonomous individual who should
learn at their own pace without the guidance of forced lectures,
attendance, classes, grading, tests and homework.

## Overview

Democratic Education still provides a facility known as a school with
facilities such as classrooms, a library, green space, a playground and
sometimes other things like a swimming pool and cafeteria. But there are
no tests, homework, grading, lecture-style classrooms or even compulsory
attendance. Children may work by themselves or in groups to learn about
what interests them, having access to teachers who act as gentle guides
and students are given all the time they need to play, explore and learn
at their own pace, leaving the school when they are ready.

## Effectiveness

Research into democratic education is limited owing to a lack of popular
knowledge of the practice and lack of government and corporate support.
Despite this, several major studies have been done:

- A study of 12 schools in the [United
  Kingdom](United_Kingdom "wikilink") by a former school inspector
  indicates that democratic schooling produces greater motivation to
  learn and self-esteem among students.[^1]
- A study done in [Israel](State_of_Israel "wikilink") indicates that
  the decline in interest in science that occurs regularly in
  conventional ([Prussian](Prussian_Education_System "wikilink"))
  schools did not occur in democratic schools.[^2]
- Three studies done on students of [Sudbury
  Schools](Sudbury_Schools "wikilink") in the [United States of
  America](United_States_of_America "wikilink") indicate that students
  "have been highly successful in their higher education (for those who
  chose that route) and careers. They have gone on to all walks of life
  that are valued in our society and report that they feel advantaged
  because of the sense of personal responsibility, self-control,
  continued interest in learning, and democratic values they acquired at
  Sudbury Valley."[^3]
- [Sands School](Sands_School "wikilink") in the [United
  Kingdom](United_Kingdom "wikilink") was inspected in 2013 by Ofsted
  was found to be ‘Good’ overall with a number of ‘Outstanding’
  features. No area of the provision was found to be less than "good’
  and all of the Statutory regulations (the school "Standards") were met
  in full. This is the same outcome as the previous inspection in 2010.
  Ofsted observed that taking part in decision-making process developed
  "exceptional qualities of thoughtfulness and the ability to offer
  balanced arguments". Good pupil achievements were found to be a
  "consequence of the democratic structures". Personal development was
  deemed to be "outstanding" because of the exceptional impact of the
  democratic principles. The inspector was particularly impressed with
  pupils’ behaviour, noting that "lessons took place in an atmosphere of
  mutual respect" and that "visitors were greeted with interest and
  impeccable manners".

- [Alia College](Alia_College "wikilink") in Melbourne,
  [Australia](Commonwealth_of_Australia "wikilink") was in the top 5 for
  Australian schools in Reading, Writing, Grammar and Punctuation
  abilities.[^4]
- [Albany Free School](Albany_Free_School "wikilink"), in Albany, United
  States of America has treated students with ADHD far better than
  surrounding schools, giving them enough play time to render medication
  unnecessary.[^5]
