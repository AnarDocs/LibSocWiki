The **Workers' Liberation Group** was an
[anarcho-communist](Anarcho-Communism "wikilink") group active in
[Iraq](Iraq "wikilink") from
[1973](Revolutions_of_1967_-_1975 "wikilink") to
[1978](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Western_Asia "wikilink") and
[Iran](Iran "wikilink") from 1978 to 1979. It had around 300 members.

## History

The group was founded after its members split from the [Iraqi Communist
Party](Iraqi_Communist_Party "wikilink") for its alliance with the
[ruling government](Ba'athist_Iraq "wikilink") and 'waged a bitter
campaign' (wording in source is unclear, likely refers to [guerilla
warfare](Guerilla_Warfare "wikilink")) against the secret police. In
1978 the entire group illegally crossed to Iran to help the anarchist
group [The Scream of The
People](The_Scream_of_The_People_(Iran) "wikilink") to help organise
[workers' councils](Workers'_Council "wikilink") and [popular
assemblies](Democratic_Assembly "wikilink") known as
[Shoras](Shoras_(Iran) "wikilink") in the [Iranian
Revolution](Iranian_Revolution "wikilink").
