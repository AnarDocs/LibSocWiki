[Marxist-Leninist](Marxist-Leninism "wikilink") (commonly called
[communist](Communism "wikilink")) government in the world.

## Debates on the Left

Given Cuba's status as the last 'true' Marxist-Leninist government left
in the world, it is subject to a lot of debate on the left about whether
or not the government is 'good' (ie struggling against the USA and the
embargo while providing excellent social programs for its citizens that
had to take hard measures to survive) or 'bad' (a corrupt oligarchy that
represses the population and destroyed any opportunity for democracy) or
a mix of both.
