The **Revolutions of 1989 - 1992**(sometimes called the **Fall of
Nations** or the **Autumn of Nations**) refers to a [revolutionary
wave](Revolutionary_Wave "wikilink") that occurred near the end of the
20th century. Unlike other revolutionary waves, it did not result in

coincided with the rise of neoliberal economics entering a much stronger
phase and the birth of the early [internet](internet "wikilink"). As a
result of the revolutionary wave, a lot of government corruption and
conspiracies were also exposed.
