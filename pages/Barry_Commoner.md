**Barry Commoner** (1917 - 2012) was a [cellular
biologist](Science "wikilink"), [medical researcher](Health "wikilink"),
[university](university "wikilink") professor, soldier,
[economist](Economics "wikilink"), [radical
ecologist](Environmentalism "wikilink") and [libertarian
socialist](Libertarian_Socialism "wikilink").

## Ideas

Most of his work was focused on how we can redesign the economy to be
more in line with natural ecosystems and reduce our impact on the
biosphere.

### Four Laws of Ecology

In 1971, he argued that the economy should be restructured around the
unbending laws of ecology which are as follows:

1.  Everything is connected to everything else. There is one ecosphere
    for all living organisms and what affects one, affects all.
2.  Everything must go somewhere. There is no "waste" in nature and
    there is no "away" to which things can be thrown.
3.  Nature knows best. Humankind has fashioned technology to improve
    upon nature, but such change in a natural system is likely to be
    detrimental to that [system](Systems_Theory "wikilink").
4.  There is no such thing as a free lunch. Exploitation of nature will
    inevitably involve the conversion of resources from useful to
    useless forms.

### Three E's

In 1976, he argued that the three main ills plaguing our society were
the environment, energy and the economy. These were all interconnected
issues, the industries that use the most energy have the most negative
impact on the environment, and the use of scarce [fossil
fuels](Fossil_Fuel "wikilink") means that prices will be pushed up as
more energy is used, hurting the economy.

## Quotes

> "Everything is connected to everything else."

> "Environmental pollution is an incurable disease. It can only be
> prevented."

> "The proper use of science is not to conquer nature but to live with
> it."

> "Our assaults on the ecosystem are so powerful, so numerous, so finely
> interconnected, that although the damage they do is clear, it is very
> difficult to discover how it was done. By which weapon? In whose hand?
> Are we driving the ecosphere to destruction simply by our growing
> numbers? By our greedy accumulation of wealth? Or are the machines
> which we have built to gain this wealth-the magnificent technology
> that now feeds us out of neat packages, that clothes us in man-made
> fibers, that surrounds us with new chemical creations-at fault?"

> "If you ask what you are going to do about [global
> warming](Climate_Change "wikilink"), the only rational answer is to
> change the way in which we do
> [transportation](transportation "wikilink"), [energy
> production](Electricity "wikilink"),
> [agriculture](agriculture "wikilink") and a good deal of
> manufacturing. The problem originates in human activity in the form of
> the production of goods."

> "If you can see the light at the end of the tunnel, you are looking
> the wrong way."

> "The environmental crisis is somber evidence of an insidious fraud
> hidden in the vaunted productivity and wealth of modern,
> technology-based society. This wealth has been gained by rapid
> short-term exploitation of the environmental system, but it has
> blindly accumulated a debt to nature-a debt so large and so pervasive
> that in the next generation it may, if unpaid, wipe out most of the
> wealth it has gained us."

> "Air pollution is not merely a nuisance and a threat to health. It is
> a reminder that our most celebrated technological achievements-the
> automobile, the jet plane, the power plant, industry in general, and
> indeed the modern city itself-are, in the environment, failures."

> "The [environmental crisis](Ecocide "wikilink") arises from a
> fundamental fault: our systems of production - in industry,
> agriculture, energy and transportation - essential as they are, make
> people sick and die."

> "Nothing ever dies, nothing ever goes away."

> "If environmentalism is a fad, it will be the last one."

> "What the new fertilizer technology has accomplished for the farmer is
> clear: more crop can be produced on less acreage than before. Since
> the cost of fertilizer, relative to the resultant gain in crop sales,
> is lower than that of any other economic input, and since the Land
> Bank pays the farmer for acreage not in crops, the new technology pays
> him well. The cost-in environmental degradation-is borne by his
> neighbors in town who find their water polluted. The new technology is
> an economic success-but only because it is an ecological failure."

> "All of the clean technologies are known, it's a question of simply
> applying them."

> "The favorite statistic is that the U.S. contains 6 to 7% of the world
> population but consumes more than half the world's resources and is
> responsible for that fraction of the total environmental pollution.
> But this statistic hides another vital fact: that not everyone in the
> U.S. is so affluent."

> "Sooner or later, wittingly or unwittingly, we must pay, for every
> intrusion on the natural environment."

> "The modern assault on the environment began about 50 years ago,
> during and immediately after [World War II](World_War_II "wikilink")."

> "Because the global ecosystem is a connected whole, in which nothing
> can be gained or lost and which is not subject to over-all
> improvement, anything extracted from it by human effort must be
> replaced. Payment of this price cannot be avoided; it can only be
> delayed. The present environmental crisis is a warning that we have
> delayed nearly too long."

> "Environmental concern is now firmly embedded in public life: in
> education, medicine and law; in journalism, literature and art."

> "It is simply economically impossible to require controls that even
> approach zero emissions."

> "World War II had a very important impact on the development of
> technology, as a whole."

> "When you fully understand the situation, it is worse than you think."

> "After all, despite the economic advantage to firms that employed
> child labor, it was in the social interest, as a national policy, to
> abolish it - removing that advantage for all firms."

> "Environmental quality was drastically improved while economic
> activity grew by the simple expedient of removing lead from gasoline -
> which prevented it from entering the environment."
