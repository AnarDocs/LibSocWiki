The **Kraakers** (named for the sound a door makes when you crowbar it)
or **Krakersrellen** is a [Dutch](Netherlands.md "wikilink")
[autonomous](Autonomism.md "wikilink") and
[squatters](Squatting.md "wikilink") movement active from [1968 until the
present](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Western_Europe.md "wikilink")
although in recent years there has been a sharp decline especially since
new laws were voted in the 2010 **kraakverbod** (squatting ban) which
crimminalised the practice.

## Rise of the Movement

From 1968, in the aftermath of the counter-culture, [squatters took over
25,000 buildings](List_of_Squats.md "wikilink") across the Netherlands in
13 years, 10,000 of which were in Amsterdam. They organize a network of
resistance to the government, creating kitchens, bars, cafes,
information centers to deal with [landlords](Landlord.md "wikilink") and
[police](police.md "wikilink") harassment, free radio stations and street
parties. This was done in response to an [economic
boom](Business_Cycle.md "wikilink") in Amsterdam, as money was pumped into
construction companies to promote a construction boom. At their peak in
the mid-1980s, there was a new squat opened every week.[^1]

## Activities

Some notably actions of the kraakers include:

- 1975: The [Battle of Nieuwmarkt](Battle_of_Nieuwmarkt.md "wikilink"),
  kraakers resist the demolition of homes
- 1980: The [Battle of Vondelstraat](Battle_of_Vondelstraat.md "wikilink"),
  seeing the Dutch government bring in tanks to help evict squatters
- 1980: The [Battle of Geen Kronung](Battle_of_Geen_Kronung.md "wikilink"),
  massive riots in response to the coronation of the Dutch queen
- 1980: The [Battle of the Lucky
  Luiyk](Battle_of_the_Lucky_Luiyk.md "wikilink") occurs, squatters and
  fascists fight in the streets
- 1983: The [Battle for Groote
  Watering](Battle_for_Groote_Watering.md "wikilink"), squatters resist
  evictions by police

  Amsterdam](Battle_of_Amsterdam_(1985).md "wikilink"), squatters resist
  evictions and police brutality
- 1986: The [Battle of Borssele](Battle_of_Borssele.md "wikilink"), as they
  tried to stop the construction of a nuclear power plant

## Decline and Collapse

The movements decline began as landlords illegally recruit criminal
enforcers to clear out occupied buildings, often dressed in American
football gear and steel-tipped boots. Welfare to students and the
unemployed was cut, and police were given greater power and funding.
Neo-fascists also began to attack squats and police refused to hold them
off. Public opinion also began to turn against the squatters in 1982 due
to the amount of destruction caused by battles. The movement also split
between radicals and non-radicals.

The radicals saw the Dutch housing crisis as another example of
capitalism's failures, and saw their own struggle as the one being waged
with stones and slingshots in occupied Palestine and with AK-47s in
Nicaragua. They felt that being afforded the luxuries of Dutch citizens
was part of their national privileges as members of an affluent society
in a corrupt world system. The non-radicals simply saw squatting as a
way to get free housing and protect themselves from homelessness, and
supported the creation of a greater [social
democracy](Social_Democracy.md "wikilink") to protect people.

The combination of increasing repression, unpopularity and internal
splits led to increasing paranoia in the movement, stagnating its
ability to grow and depend on community support. A breakdown in trust
and mutual aid led to the movement losing 24,000 squats in less than 10
years without an ability to create new squats. Surviving squats were
converted into low-rent housing for squatters to live in, forcing them
to act like lawyers and [reintegrating](Co-optation.md "wikilink") them
into capitalist society.
