**Authoritarian Socialism**, also the USSR is based, is one of the three
major socialist ideologies, alongside [democratic
socialism](Democratic_Socialism.md "wikilink") and [libertarian
socialism](Libertarian_Socialism.md "wikilink"). Of the three, it has been
by far the most historically influential, even becoming one of the two
major forces of the [Cold War](Cold_War.md "wikilink") and being largely
responsible for winning [World War II](World_War_II.md "wikilink"). It
refers to an effort to build a socialist society that differs from
libertarian socialists on four main areas:

- The [state's](State_(Polity).md "wikilink") role in history is viewed
  completely differently. For authoritarian socialists, the state was a
  product of [class divisions](Class.md "wikilink") which emerged alongside
  the development of [agriculture](agriculture.md "wikilink") and cannot be
  gotten rid of in the short run without having huge side effects which
  would destroy socialism. Whereas libertarian socialists view the state
  as an independent entity that accumulates power on its own will and
  predates class.
- Decisions are not to be made via popular assemblies and regional
  confederations, but instead through a one-party dictatorship with
  little to no input from the general public. According to authoritarian
  socialists, this is necessary to maintain the organizational
  efficiency necessary to defend socialism from
  [counter-revolutionaries](Counter-Revolution.md "wikilink") and
  warmongering capitalists.
- Industry is to be [nationalized](Nationalization.md "wikilink") and
  operated according to the will of the state. Industry may have some
  degree of [workers'
  self-management](Workers'_Self-Management.md "wikilink"), as in
  [Yugoslavia](Federal_Socialist_Republic_of_Yugoslavia.md "wikilink").
  This is done in order to ensure the most effective use of resources
  towards building socialism.
- Dissent is to be harshly punished in order to create a stable and
  harmonious society and to protect the gains made for workers.

## Criticism

The main criticism of authoritarian socialism advanced by [libertarian
socialists](Libertarian_Socialism.md "wikilink") are:

- The authoritarian socialist conception of the state is based on
  outdated or misleading historical data. More recent evidence shows
  that the state emerged long before class divisions, and is usually
  based on factors such as [religious](Religion.md "wikilink")
  worship.[^1][^2]
- If decision-making power is not distributed among the population, it
  will create a small elite isolated from the consequences of their
  actions who will quickly become consumed by greed and paranoia,
  violently maintaining their control over the population and ultimately
  reinstating [capitalism](capitalism.md "wikilink") to ensure their own
  wealth and power.[^3]
- The belief that hierarchical organizations are more efficient that
  non-hierarchical ones is conflicting with existing evidence[^4],
  especially within the military, where decentralized forces frequently
  defeat centralized ones despite having access to inferior equipment,
  knowledge and army size.[^5]
- Nationalization of industry or limited workers' self-management only
  creates a bitter and [alienated](Alienation.md "wikilink") workforce, who
  may begin to sympathize strongly with [far-right
  anti-communist](Fascism.md "wikilink") ideas.[^6]
