## Life

### Early Life

Tcheng was at first home-schooled and then enrolled at a formal school

picked by her grandfather. Her family sent her to a mission school in
Tianjin, where she learned English but refused the religion.

Shizeng](Li_Shizeng "wikilink") and enrolled in the school to prepare to
go to France on the Diligent Work Frugal Study program. The school was
the first in China to be co-educational. She was one of the handful of
women to go to [France](French_Republic "wikilink") on the program. She
wrote later that she and Li were part of a terrorism cell which was
involved in the attempted assassination of the emperor of China.

### Later Life

Conference and received her doctorate of law from the
[University](University "wikilink") of Paris in 1926. She married the
lawyer Wei Tao-ming and they moved to Shanghai to establish a law firm.
She became a the first female judge in
[China](People's_Republic_of_China "wikilink"). She died of cancer in
San Francisco, 1959.[^1]
