**102 Eaton Square** or **Belgravia** was an unused mansion in London,
UK that had occupied by [squatters](List_of_Squats "wikilink")
(belonging to [Autonomous Nation of Anarchist
Libertarians](Autonomous_Nation_of_Anarchist_Libertarians "wikilink"))
and turned into a homeless shelter in
[2017](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Northern_Europe "wikilink").

## History

The squat was occupied in early 2017 and quickly attacked by local
fascists who tried to break into the building, but the squatters fought
them off. The squatters soon housed 25 homeless people and began holding
movie nights.[^1] They were evicted within a month by police in a
two-hour standoff, where the squatters barricaded themselves in but were
defeated by police.[^2]
