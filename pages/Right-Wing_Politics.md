**Right-Wing Politics** or the **Political Right** are a range of
political perspectives which emphasise the importance, benefits,
inevitability and normalcy of hierarchy. Right-wing politics often
emphasises the importance of concepts like loyalty, respect for
authority, purity, family, tradition, hard work and a natural order. In
addition, strong belief in [capitalism](capitalism.md "wikilink") and
opposition to modern social justice movements is seen as a right-wing
belief, despite frequent conflicts with the anti-capitalist right.

## Psychology

According to Moral Foundations Theory, right-wing politics values the
concept of:

- *Care*: cherishing and protecting others; opposite of *harm*
- *Fairness*: rendering justice according to shared rules; opposite of
  *cheating*
- *Loyalty* or *ingroup*: standing with your group, family, nation;
  opposite of *betrayal*
- *Authority* or *respect*: submitting to tradition and legitimate
  authority; opposite of *subversion*
- *Sanctity* or *purity*: abhorrence for disgusting things, foods,
  actions; opposite of *degradation*

In contrast to the [political left](Left-Wing_Politics.md "wikilink"), who
only embrace the concepts of *care* and *fairness*, and value the
concepts much more highly.
