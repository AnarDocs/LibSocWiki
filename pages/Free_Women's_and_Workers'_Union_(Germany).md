The **Free Women's and Workers' Union** (**FAU**) is
[federation](Confederation.md "wikilink") of
[anarcho-syndicalist](Anarcho-Syndicalism.md "wikilink")
[unions](Trade_Union.md "wikilink") based in [Germany](Germany.md "wikilink").

## History

### Founding

Founded in
[1977](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Germany.md "wikilink") after
the re-emergence of the
[CNT](National_Confederation_of_Labour_(Spain).md "wikilink") in the
[Second Spanish Revolution](Second_Spanish_Revolution.md "wikilink"), the
new FAU saw itself as the successor of the [Free Workers' Union of
Germany](Free_Workers'_Union_of_Germany.md "wikilink"), which broke up in
1933 to avoid persecution from the [new
government](Nazi_Germany.md "wikilink").

### Major Actions

In 2007, FAU members organised a [bicycle](bicycle.md "wikilink")
[factory](factory.md "wikilink") in and helped [takeover the bike
factory](StrikeBike.md "wikilink") and run it as a [self-managed
workplace](Workers'_Self-Management.md "wikilink"). In 2009, FAU members
protested the Babylon Cinema in Berlin after the unjust firing of
workers, leading to the Berlin Court to forbid the FAU from calling
itself a union. Romanian construction workers with the FAU also began a
strike at the Mall of Berlin after they had not been paid for months.
They FAU also helps organise food delivery drivers, notably helping in
[Black Friday](Black_Friday_(Germany).md "wikilink").[^1]
