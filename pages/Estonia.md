**Estonia** is a [liberal](Liberalism "wikilink")
[capitalist](Capitalism "wikilink") [state](List_of_States "wikilink")
in Eastern Europe near [Finland](Finland "wikilink"),
[Russia](Russia "wikilink") and [Latvia](Latvia "wikilink").

## History

Estonia has been inhabited for around 11,000 years, with Ancient
Estonians being some of the last Europeans to adopt
[Christianity](Christianity "wikilink"). After centuries of successive
rule by Germans, Danes, Swedes, Poles and Russians, a distinct Estonian
national identity began to emerge in the 19th and early 20th centuries.
This culminated in independence from Russia in 1920 after a brief War of
Independence at the end of World War I. Initially democratic prior to
the Great Depression, Estonia experienced authoritarian rule from 1934
during the Era of Silence. During World War II Estonia was repeatedly
contested and occupied by the Soviet Union and Germany, ultimately being
incorporated into the former. After the loss of its *de facto*
independence, Estonia's *de jure* state continuity was preserved by
diplomatic representatives and the government-in-exile. In 1987 the
peaceful Singing Revolution began against Soviet rule, resulting in the
restoration of *de facto* independence on 20 August 1991. Since then,
Estonia has developed into a technologically advanced, socially
progressive [social democracy](Social_Democracy "wikilink").

## Positives

- The capital city of Tallinn (population: 441,000 people) made public
  transport in the city completely free in 2013. This raised worker
  satisfaction (drivers no longer had to argue with fare evaders or sell
  tickets), reduced car use, increased the mobility of the poor; parents
  and pensioners. Contrary to the frequent predictions of skeptics, the
  quality of public transport was not lowered and vandalism did not
  increase. This is the largest area of the world with free public
  transport all year around.[^1]
- Estonia has one of the most well-educated populations in the world,
  considered to have the 13th highest quality education system in the
  world and with 89% of people aged 25-64 having finished high school,
  both above average for a first world country and some of the highest
  in the world.
- Estonia provides free universal healthcare to all of its citizens and
  it works very well. Estonia has the lowest maternal death rate in the
  world and a life expectancy of 78.6 years, the third-highest of any
  post-communist state (after Slovenia and Czechia).
- Estonia legalised homosexuality in 1992, just a year after
  independence from the homophobic USSR.
- Estonia provides the longest amount of maternity leave of any country
  in the world.
- Estonia is considered one of, if not the, freest country in the world.
  It scores highly on human development, gender equality, environmental
  protection, free time and peace indexes.
- Estonia has embraced the internet. Most public spaces have free Wi-Fi,
  you can get most government documents or do business online, it is
  ranked 1st in internet freedom globally and held the first elections
  that you could vote online in in 2005.[^2]

## Negatives

- Estonia still has a large amount of racial discrimination against the
  Russian and Roma minorities in the country.[^3]
- Homophobia is common.
- Human trafficking is common.
- Estonia is oddly unhappy compared to other 'first world' countries.
