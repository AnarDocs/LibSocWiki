**Community Forestry** refers to community control and ownership of
nearby [forests](Forest.md "wikilink"). This is often done with an emphasis
on [democracy](democracy.md "wikilink") and the
[commons](commons.md "wikilink").

## Examples

### Bulgaria

### Canada

### India

### Italy

### Mexico

Community forestry has been introduced in the [Zapatista
Communities](Rebel_Zapatista_Autonomous_Municipalities.md "wikilink") and
[Cherán](Cherán.md "wikilink"). In the former it has helped to plant 30,000
trees and in the latter it has helped reforest 20,000 hectares of
deforested land (in a town of 16,000! making it the largest
reforestation program per capita in the world!)

### Nepal

### Russia

Community forestry has been introduced in the Gassinski Forest covering
an area of about 3,850 km2 by the [Russian](Russia.md "wikilink")
government.
