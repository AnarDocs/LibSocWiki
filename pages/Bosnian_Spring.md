The **Bosnian Spring** was a [failed
revolution](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Revolutions "wikilink") in
[Bosnia and Herzegovina](Bosnia_and_Herzegovina "wikilink") in
[2014](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Southern_Europe "wikilink")
with strong [libertarian socialist](Libertarian_Socialism "wikilink")
characteristics, notably the establishment of many [popular
assemblies](Democratic_Assembly "wikilink").

## Background

Following the [collapse of socialist
Yugoslavia](Collapse_of_Yugoslavia "wikilink") and [bloody ethnic
wars](Yugoslav_Wars "wikilink") that followed, the former areas of
Yugoslavia (Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo,
Montenegro and North Macedonia) were all deeply traumatised. After
attempted [privatisations](Privatisation "wikilink") of major industries
in Bosnia led to their bankruptcy and thousands of people becoming
[unemployed](Unemployment "wikilink"), there was a strong degree of
angry.

## Analysis

The Bosnian Spring has recieved a fair amount of analysis from

and

who noted that the revolution was not based on any kind of nationalism
(like Eurodaiman in Ukraine) but instead class struggle.
