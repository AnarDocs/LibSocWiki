The **Bosnian Spring** was a [failed
revolution](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Revolutions.md "wikilink") in
[Bosnia and Herzegovina](Bosnia_and_Herzegovina.md "wikilink") in
[2014](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Southern_Europe.md "wikilink")
with strong [libertarian socialist](Libertarian_Socialism.md "wikilink")
characteristics, notably the establishment of many [popular
assemblies](Democratic_Assembly.md "wikilink").

## Background

Following the [collapse of socialist
Yugoslavia](Collapse_of_Yugoslavia.md "wikilink") and [bloody ethnic
wars](Yugoslav_Wars.md "wikilink") that followed, the former areas of
Yugoslavia (Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo,
Montenegro and North Macedonia) were all deeply traumatised. After
attempted [privatisations](Privatisation.md "wikilink") of major industries
in Bosnia led to their bankruptcy and thousands of people becoming
[unemployed](Unemployment.md "wikilink"), there was a strong degree of
angry.

## Analysis

The Bosnian Spring has recieved a fair amount of analysis from
[crimethinc](crimethinc.md "wikilink")
[here](https://crimethinc.com/2014/02/18/anarchists-in-the-bosnian-uprising)
and
[here](https://crimethinc.com/2016/05/13/feature-born-in-flames-died-in-plenums-the-bosnian-experiment-with-direct-democracy-2014)
who noted that the revolution was not based on any kind of nationalism
(like Eurodaiman in Ukraine) but instead class struggle.
