![](Surplusvalue.JPG "Surplusvalue.JPG") **Surplus Value** (sometimes
called [profit](profit "wikilink")) is a key concept in
[socialist](Socialism "wikilink") (and especially
[marxist](Marxism "wikilink")) understanding at how
[capitalism](capitalism "wikilink") operates. It refers to the
difference of money generated for a business by its
[workers](Working_Class "wikilink") and the amount of
[money](money "wikilink") that is actually paid to workers in the form
of [wages](Wage_Labour "wikilink").

## Justifications for Extraction

### Risk taken by Capitalist

The idea that profit is a reward for the amount of risk taken by someone
in starting a business (willingness to sacrifice their own savings or go
into [debt](debt "wikilink")). Anti-Capitalists have five
counter-arguments:

1.  The returns on property income are utterly independent on the amount
    of risk involved.
2.  All human acts involve risk of some kind, so why should property
    owners gain exclusively from it?
3.  Risk as such it not rewarded, only <strong>successful</strong> risks
    are and what constitutes success is dependent on production, i.e.
    exploiting labour.
4.  Most “risk” related non-labour income today plays
    <strong>no</strong> part in aiding production and, indeed, is simply
    not that risky due to state intervention providing various forms of
    insurance.
5.  Fifthly, risk in this context is not independent of owning capital
    and, consequently, the arguments against “waiting” and innovation
    apply equally to this rationale. In other words, “risk” is simply
    yet another excuse to reward the rich for being wealthy.
