revolution](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Revolutions "wikilink") in
[Argentina](Argentina "wikilink") in the [early
2000s](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_South_America "wikilink").

## Background

## Events

## Results

The Argentinazo, while it failed the completely transform Argentina into
a libertarian socialist society, did manage to

- Most importantly, the Argentinazo helped give birth to a new
  generation of activists, who have led dozens of struggles for workers'
  control.<ref>[Argentina: Ten years of workers'
  control](https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/argentina-ten-years-workers-control)

</ref>

- It likely led to the end of the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas
  which would've brought greater
  [neoliberalism](neoliberalism "wikilink") to all of South America.[^1]

## Analysis

The failure of the Argentinazo to create a libertarian socialist
Argentina largely lied in the fact that the movement did not resist
[co-optation](co-optation "wikilink") by political parties who claimed
they would change the system.
