## Life

### Early Life

Elinor Claire Awan was born in Los Angeles, California as the only child
of Leah Hopkins, a musician, and Adrian Awan, a set designer. Her
parents separated early in her life, and Elinor lived with her mother
most of the time. She attended a Protestant church with her mother and
often spent weekends with her father's Jewish family. Growing up in the
post-Depression era to divorced artisans, Ostrom described herself as a
"poor kid." Her major recreational activity was swimming, where she
eventually joined a swimming team and swam competitively until she
started teaching swimming to earn funds to help put herself through
college.
