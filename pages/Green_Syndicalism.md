**Green Syndicalism** is a synthesis of
[environmentalist](Environmentalism.md "wikilink") and
[syndicalist](Syndicalism.md "wikilink") philosophy, arguing that an end to
[capitalism](capitalism.md "wikilink") and [workers'
self-management](Workers'_Self-Management.md "wikilink") is the only way to
create an [ecologically-friendly
civilization](Sustainability.md "wikilink").

## History

Green Syndicalism draws early inspiration from the Australian [Green
Bans](Green_Bans.md "wikilink") movement and the [Lucas Aerospace
Plan](Lucas_Aerospace_Plan.md "wikilink") in the 1970s. Most inspiration
comes from [Judi Bari's](Judi_Bari.md "wikilink") efforts to organize
timber workers with [Earth First!](Earth_First!.md "wikilink") in an
alliance against logging corporations in Northern California in the late
1980s.
