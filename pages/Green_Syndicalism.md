**Green Syndicalism** is a synthesis of
[environmentalist](Environmentalism "wikilink") and
[syndicalist](Syndicalism "wikilink") philosophy, arguing that an end to
[capitalism](capitalism "wikilink") and [workers'
self-management](Workers'_Self-Management "wikilink") is the only way to
create an [ecologically-friendly
civilization](Sustainability "wikilink").

## History

Green Syndicalism draws early inspiration from the Australian [Green
Bans](Green_Bans "wikilink") movement and the [Lucas Aerospace
Plan](Lucas_Aerospace_Plan "wikilink") in the 1970s. Most inspiration
comes from [Judi Bari's](Judi_Bari "wikilink") efforts to organize
timber workers with [Earth First!](Earth_First! "wikilink") in an
alliance against logging corporations in Northern California in the late
1980s.
