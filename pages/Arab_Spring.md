The **Arab Spring** was a chain of [revolutions](Revolution.md "wikilink"),
armed insurrection, riots and protests across the 'Arab World' (much of
North Africa and Western Asia) from late
[2010](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Northern_Africa.md "wikilink")
to [2012](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Western_Asia.md "wikilink").
The event toppled several dictators, caused several civil wars, led to
major reforms and inspired movements like,
[Occupy](Occupy_Movement.md "wikilink"), [Gezi
Park](Gezi_Park_Uprising.md "wikilink") and the [Second Arab
Spring](Second_Arab_Spring.md "wikilink"). It was part of a broader [global
revolutionary wave from 2008 to
2014](Revolutions_of_2008_-_2014.md "wikilink").

## Causes

Common to all the revolutions, uprisings, strikes, protests and civil

stagnation and a lack of political freedoms. Additionally, seeing the
success of revolts in [one country can trigger revolts in
another](Domino_Theory.md "wikilink"), with the revolt that began in
Tunisia, itself inspired by unrest in Spain.
