**Panteleimon Fedorovich Belochub**was an
[anarchist](Anarchism.md "wikilink"), [Black
Army](Black_Army_(Ukraine).md "wikilink") commander and
[farmer](Agriculture.md "wikilink").

## Life

Born into a peasant family in rural Ukraine, he became an anarchist who
sympathised with the [Bolsheviks](Bolsheviks.md "wikilink") in
[1917](February_Revolution_(Russia).md "wikilink"), and joined the [Black
Army of Ukraine](Black_Army_(Ukraine).md "wikilink") in 1919 and commanded
a horse artillery unit. He helped defeated Red Army units at the battle
of Stepovaya, and was arrested by the
[Kontrrazvedka](Kontrrazvedka.md "wikilink") for conspiracy to assasinate
[Makhno](Nestor_Makhno.md "wikilink") but was later released. He helped
defeat the White Army at the battle of Wrangel in 1920 and deserted the
Makhnovists in February 1921, giving himself up to the Bolsheviks for
amnesty.

He returned to his native village and worked as a farmer and became
chair of the village council. He was invited to the underground Nabat
conference in Kharkov, but it was sabotaged by an unknown person
([Viktor Belash](Viktor_Belash.md "wikilink") is suspected) and turned into
the Cheka, leading to 70 anarchists being arrested. Pantaleimon tried to
find other anarchists in 1927 across Ukraine, and met Belochub and
Avraam Budanov, who were highly suspicious of him. But they agreed and
distributed anarchist pamphlets to workers and peasants in Ukraine,
being arrested for it in 1928, and Pantaleimon was executed by firing
squad in 1929.[^1]
