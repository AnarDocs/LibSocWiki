The **Benin Uprising of 1989** was a series of
[strikes](List_of_General_Strikes.md "wikilink") and riots by workers and
students in [Socialist Benin](Socialist_Benin.md "wikilink") in
[1989](Revolutions_of_1986_-_1992.md "wikilink") and
[1990](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Western_Africa.md "wikilink")
against the authoritarian government, poor living conditions and desire
for a new society.

## Background

Benin had been a [Marxist-Leninist](Marxist-Leninism.md "wikilink") state
since 1974, and throughout the 1980s the economy was failing and
implemented [neoliberal](Neoliberalism.md "wikilink") reforms suggested by
the IMF. In the midst of a massive economic crisis, loss of social
support and rising cost of living.

## Events

One of these IMF reforms was to end student scholarships, which began a
strike which soldiers were sent to disperse and arrested some. Soon,
school teachers and several civil servants began to strike over unpaid
wages, also employing go-slows. Students went on indefinite strike and
the government argued to fire all these strikers. Soon, students began
battling police (throwing stones and chairs), looting government
buildings and burning pictures of the president. The government
announced increased militarisation of the country and the sacking of all
striking civil servants, being replaced with younger university
graduates.

Teachers left and later rejoined the strike after a 50% cut in wages and
demanded the release of arrested strikers. Soon the government began to
pay the teachers but refused to pay their stolen wages. The government
closed all schools for the year to destroy the strikes. However, it soon
began to cave further into releasing all political prisoners but also
cancelling the next year of school. After an announcement for
democratisation and transition to capitalism, 40,000 people protested
against the government, attempting to burn down a statue of Lenin, they
killed several police (who also killed protesters). In several towns,
citizens attempted to replace mayors with their own elected officials.
Police arrested at least one of these citizen-elected mayors.

## Results

At the beginning of 1991 the transition government held successful
liberal democratic elections. Although the university held a separate
strike for educational changes several months after the end of their
year long strike, they appeared to have received most of their initial
economic goals. It is also not clear how much of the salary arrears were
eventually paid to teachers and civil servants.
