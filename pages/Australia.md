## History

*See Also: [Aboriginal Australia](Aboriginal_Australia "wikilink"),
[History of Australia](History_of_Australia "wikilink") and [Timeline of
Australian Atrocrities](Timeline_of_Australian_Atrocrities "wikilink")*

Australia was first discovered around 90,000 years ago by [Aboriginal
Australians](Aboriginal_Australians "wikilink") who had come from an
unknown region in Southern or Southeast Asia. Aboriginal Australians
soon settled the whole continent, living as foragers and domesticating
wild dogs (dingoes). Around 4,000 years ago, Aboriginals developed
agriculture, fish traps and permanent settlements of around 10,000
people.[^1]

Dutch ships made various landings and explored some of Australia
throughout the 1600s. (although it is theorised that Portugal, China or
an Islamic Caliphate contacted aborigines first). It became a region of
the British Empire in 1788 (illegal under Britain's own laws, given the
existence of Aboriginals), in order to stop the French Empire from
taking it and to make up for land lost in the [American
Revolution](American_Revolution "wikilink") in 1775.

Australia underwent significant amounts of modernisation and
urbanisation from the 1950s onwards, and the 1970s saw significant
amounts of unrest across the country, leading to a large and developed
[social democratic](Social_Democracy "wikilink") welfare state in order
to placate the masses. It began to be slowly dismantled over the 1980s
to the 2010s, which saw Australians also gain access to the internet at
the same time as work became insecure and rent soared.

## Analysis

### Positives

- Australia is a highly developed country, with the world's 14th-largest
  economy. It has a high-income economy, with the world's tenth-highest
  per capita income. Having the third-highest human development index
  and the eighth-highest ranked democracy globally, the country ranks
  highly in quality of life, health, education, economic freedom, civil
  liberties, and political rights, with all its major cities faring well
  in global comparative livability surveys.

### Negatives

C*ontent warning: discussion of racism, sexual assault and genocide
ahead*

- [Australia has issues with sexism](Sexism_in_Australia "wikilink"),
  despite it having been reduced massively in the past 60 years. There
  is still a major wage gap that effects women, and sexual assault.
  Numerous Australian women have experienced domestic violence in their
  homes. In 2018, it was reported that one in two women have experienced
  sexual harassment and one in three women have experienced physical or
  sexual violence. In 2018, it was reported that one in five Australian
  women have experienced violence by an intimate partner since the age
  of 15. As a result, intimate partner violence is the largest
  contributor to ill health, death, and disability for many women. This
  is larger than any other contributor to ill health for women such as
  obesity, alcohol, and illicit drugs. However, men are much more likely
  to be homeless, commit suicide or be arrested by police. These issues
  are massively compounded in Australia's indigenous communities.[^2]
- [Australia has issues with racism](Racism_in_Australia "wikilink"),
  especially towards the indigenous population.
- In 2010â€“2012, the estimated life expectancy at birth for Aboriginal
  and Torres Strait Islander males was 69.1 years, and for females 73.7
  years. This was 10.6 years lower than the life expectancy of
  non-Indigenous males, and 9.5 yearslower than that of non-Indigenous
  females. A 2006 study by the Australian Institute of Health and
  Welfare showed that 70% of the Aboriginal population die before the
  age of 65, compared with 20% of non-Indigenous Australians.
  Additionally, the suicide rate among Aboriginal Australians is almost
  three times higher (at 4.2%) than the national average (1.5%).

- Poverty is increasing in Australia, some fast facts:
  - According to financial analysts, <strong>over 46 percent of
    Australians are living from paycheck to paycheck, with no financial
    fallback</strong>. To put things into perspective, this means that
    5.9 million Australians would be in deep trouble if they suddenly
    lost their jobs. The report also reveals that only 36 percent of
    Australians would be able to live off their saving for four months
    before they also find themselves in a tight spot.[^3]
  - More than one in eight adults and more than one in six children are
    living in poverty.[^4]

<!-- -->

- - The Australian Bureau of Statistics says the total number of
    homeless Australians increased by 14% to 116,427 between the last
    census in 2011 and the latest in 2016.[^5]
