**African Anarchism: The History of a Movement** is a 2001
[book](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Books.md "wikilink") by [Sam

Africa.

## Summary

### Chapter 1: What Is Anarchism?

### Chapter 2: Anarchism In History

### Chapter 3: Anarchistic Precedents in Africa

### Chapter 4: The Development of Socialism in Africa

### Chapter 5: The Failure of Socialism in Africa

### Chapter 6: Obstacles to the Development of Anarchism in Africa

Africa has one of the smallest anarchist movements of any continent,
especially when compared to the [Global North](Global_North.md "wikilink").
Some of the factors holding back the growth of an anarchist movement in
Africa include:

- The education system that instills isolation in people
- The harsh nature of the law in many African countries
- The ruthless power of warlords, corrupt militaries and gangs
- Racial tensions and ethnic hatred
- The conservative, reactionary and divisive nature of many African
  religions.
- Lack of international support and solidarity from the Global North

### Chapter 7: Anarchism’s Future in Africa

The failures of [capitalism](capitalism.md "wikilink") and [authoritarian
socialism](Authoritarian_Socialism.md "wikilink") offer hope for
[anarchism](anarchism.md "wikilink") as a political project. Throughout
history, the overall tendency in the development of human society has
been toward social equality and greater individual freedom. The pace has
seemed agonizingly slow and there have been innumerable setbacks, but
the overall trend is undeniable. Change has been the one constant in
this development, and it almost certainly will be the one constant in
the future.

Africa has possibly been the worst victim of capitalism and
authoritarian socialism, having its resources bled try from colonialism
and its population annihilated by the tens of millions to fund a slave
trade and imperial ambitions. Multinational corporations and the IMF
have destroyed the ability for the continent to develop itself, leaving
it poor. The rapid loss of wealth have also triggered numerous civil
wars and orgies of violence, disintegrating of the
[state](State_(Polity).md "wikilink"). Many of these issues are placed on
'natural' racism, but these tensions were flamed by capitalists and
governments to suit their own interests.

An anarchist movement in Africa might be very easy to build, as it lacks
a clear and stable system of states and capitalism. What is needed is a
long-term program of class consciousness building, relevant education,
and increased individual participation in social struggles. For Africa
in particular, long-term development is possible only if there is a
radical break with both capitalism and the state system - the principal
instruments of our arrested development and stagnation. Anarchism is
Africa’s way out.
