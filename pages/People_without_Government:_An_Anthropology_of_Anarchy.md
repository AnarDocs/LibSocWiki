**People Without Government: An Anthropology of Anarchy** is a 1990
[book](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Books.md "wikilink") by [Harold
Barclay](Harold_Barclay.md "wikilink") which explores various [anarchist
societies](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Societies.md "wikilink") in
various stages of economic production (from
[forager](Forager_Economy.md "wikilink") to
[farming](Agriculture.md "wikilink") to [industrial](Factory.md "wikilink")).

## Summary

### On The Nature of Anarchy

### Some Observations of Procedure

### Anarchy Among Hunter-Gatherers

Forager societies are the oldest and most natural way of organising a
group of people. Yet almost nobody lives like this, often trading luxury
furs for vehicles and weapons on the international capitalist market.

The [Inuit](Inuit.md "wikilink") (who live in the Arctic region of North
America) have organised into an anarchist systems, living in small
[bands](Band_(Polity).md "wikilink") with no fixed rulers (although there
are some trusted leaders based on their skill and knowledge) and near
gender equality. Yet Inuit society is also fairly violent, with disputes
not solved with restorative means but instead through various
competitions like wrestling. Gossip and shame are used to stop
undesirable behaviour, but people often get away with crimes. Inuit
society also demonstrates the Tyranny of Structurelessness, with
religious shaman (responsible for medical care and communication with
the gods) often have disproportionate power in a society. Inuits show
that proto-hierarchical forms of domination might emerge through
religion as certain figures carry a monopoly on spirituality.
