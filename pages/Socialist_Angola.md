### Positives

- Major efforts were made to combat illiteracy and lack of education. In
  1986, the number of primary school students exceeded one and a half
  million, and nearly half a million adults learned to read and write.
  The language of instruction remained mainly Portuguese, but
  experiments were tried to introduce the study of local African
  languages from the first years of schooling.
