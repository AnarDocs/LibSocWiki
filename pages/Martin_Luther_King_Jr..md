**Martin Luther King Jr.** was a Baptist minister, socialist and black
activist who became the most visible spokesperson and leader in the
[American civil rights
movement](American_Civil_Rights_Movement.md "wikilink") from 1955 until his
assassination in 1968. Born in Atlanta, King is best known for advancing
civil rights through nonviolence and civil disobedience, inspired by his
Christian beliefs and the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi.

## Assassination

### Shooting

Standing on a second-floor balcony at a hotel in Memphis, Tennessee,
King was shot to death.

### Conspiracy Theories

[Conspiracy theories](Conspiracy_Theory.md "wikilink") around the shooting
argue that James either did not act alone or was not even the shooter.

#### Evidence For

- Soloman Jones, a volunteer who often drove King around town when he
  was in Memphis. After he heard the shots, he ran into the street. He
  related what he saw to the police that night, "I could see a person in
  the thicket on the west side of Mulberry with his back to me, looked
  like he had a \[white\]<ref>YouTube (2018) - [Solomon Jones and the

hood over his head." The next day, Memphis public work employees removed
the bushes, destroying the crime scene.[^1]

- In 1979, the [United States House Select Committee on
  Assassinations](United_States_House_Select_Committee_on_Assassinations.md "wikilink")
  (HSCA) released a report stating that there was a likelihood of
  conspiracy in the assassination of King. However, the committee
  believed that the government was not involved, and it was an action by
  [white supremacists](White_Supremacy.md "wikilink").[^2]
- In 1997, tests on the bullets that killed King did not match the
  bullets fired by the rifle owned by James.<ref>CNN (1997) - [Ray
  lawyer: Test bullets don't match bullet that killed
  King](http://edition.cnn.com/US/9707/11/king.rifle.update/)

</ref>

- In 1999, a mixed-race Memphis jury ruled that the local, state and
  federal governments were liable for Kingâ€™s death.[^3]

#### Evidence Against

- In 2000, the Department of Justice completed their own investigation
  into Jowers' claims; it did not find evidence to support the
  allegations about conspiracy. The investigation report recommends no
  further investigation unless some new reliable facts are presented.

### Riots

The **King assassination riots**, also known as the **Holy Week
Uprising**, was a wave of civil disturbance which swept the United
States following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4,
1968. It was the greatest wave of social unrest the United States had
experienced since the Civil War. Some of the biggest riots took place in
Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Chicago, and Kansas City.[^4]
