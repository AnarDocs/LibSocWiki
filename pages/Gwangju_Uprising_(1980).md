The **Gwangju Uprising** in
[1980](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Eastern_Asia "wikilink") was
a spontaneous, week-long, violent insurrection against the military
dictatorship of General Chun Doo-Hwan by
[workers](Working_Class "wikilink") and [students](Student "wikilink")
in the [South Korean](Republic_of_Korea "wikilink") city of Gwangju.
Although the rebellion was a disaster in military terms, it led to a
political victory, inspiring a wave of democratic uprisings across Asia,
granting freedoms to hundreds of millions of people and eventually
creating a progressive democracy in South Korea.
