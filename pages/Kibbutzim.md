**Kibbutzim**or **Kibbutz** are [intentional
communities](Intentional_Community "wikilink") spread across
[Israel](State_of_Israel "wikilink") and are connected to the left-wing
of the [Zionist](Zionism "wikilink") movement. They have an estimated
population of 120,000 people spread over [270
communities](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Societies "wikilink") (or an
average of 444 people per community).[^1] [Noam
Chomsky](Noam_Chomsky "wikilink") has said the early kibbutzim "came
closer to the [anarchist](Anarchism "wikilink") ideal than any other
attempt that lasted for more than a very brief moment before
destruction". [Graham Purchase](Graham_Purchase "wikilink") wrote that
the kibbutz became "exactly the sort of modern communal village/small
town life which [Kropotkin](Peter_Kropotkin "wikilink") had envisaged".

## Decision-Making

Kibbutzim make decisions using [democratic town
meetings](Democratic_Assembly "wikilink"). At once Kibbutz:

> Members met twice a week at town meetings to make decisions on items
> like the budget, electing officers, and punishing people who broke the
> community rules. Members elected a general secretary who prepared the
> meeting agendas, chaired the meetings, and served as the kibbutz's
> delegate in the [federation](Confederation "wikilink") of kibbutzim.
> The secretary received assistance from a secretariat, a nominating
> committee, an education committee, a high school committee, a cultural
> committee, a welfare committee, a security committee, and a landscape
> committee. Every kibbutz member at some point served as an officer, in
> a committee, or in some other position of authority. No officer was
> allowed to serve for more than two or three years, and the positions,
> like all work on the kibbutz, were unpaid.[^2]

## Crime

According to Wikipedia: "the crime rate \[in the Kibbutz\] is lower than
the national average by a significant margin."[^3] In 1940, a British
airman stationed in Palestine wrote that in the kibbutzim, "The problem
of violence has simply not arisen". In 1986, a study on Kibbutz Vatik
noted that the kibbutz had never experienced any serious crime. James
Horrox comments that these "remarks on the non-existence of crime were
all made at a time when many of the communities were of equivalent size
to small towns, or at least large villages, many of them housing well
over a thousand people each."[^4]

## Economy

With the absence of a fixed system of monetary rewards or punishments,
four incentives emerged from the Kibbutz to get people to work:

1.  Group productivity affects the whole community’s standard of living
2.  Members control and choose where they
    [work](Workers'_Self-Management "wikilink"), gaining lots of
    satisfaction from labor
3.  People develop personal feelings of pride about their work
4.  People gain prestige and recognition from other members of the
    Kibbutz[^5]

Kibbutz members work two hours more a week than the average Israeli[^6]
and despite having \<1% of Israel's population, Kibbutz produce 9% of
manufactured goods and 40% of Israel's agriculture.[^7]

## Environmental Protection

Kibbutz Lotan, with its Center for Creative Ecology, practices and
teaches visitors about organic gardening and construction with materials
from the local landbase. The kibbutz's Center for Creative Ecology is
also an environmental education, research and conservation institution.
The Center offers academic programs in conjunction with the
[University](University "wikilink") of Massachusetts Amherst and
certification courses in [permaculture](permaculture "wikilink"),
[sustainable design](Sustainability "wikilink") and training. Facilities
include an interactive park for organic and urban
[agriculture](agriculture "wikilink"), natural building and solar energy
demonstrations as well as the energy-efficient EcoCampus, a neighborhood
constructed from earth-plastered straw bales. The kibbutz's website
reports, "Over the last four years Lotan, through its composting and
recycling efforts, has reduced its overall waste disposal by 70% each
year."[^8]

Kibbutz Ketura is leading Israel's development of solar technology,
becoming a popular eco tourism attraction.[^9]
