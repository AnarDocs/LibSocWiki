A list of successful and failed [libertarian
socialist](Libertarian_Socialism "wikilink") revolutions. *Revolutions*
are efforts to institute a new political system along libertarian
socialist lines.

Note, none of these were successful and none of them actually built
socialism let alone communism. Even "successful" revolutions like those
with the Zapatistas ultimately ended in failure after a few decades.
Marxism-Leninism, not radical liberalism, is the only path for the
international proletariat.
