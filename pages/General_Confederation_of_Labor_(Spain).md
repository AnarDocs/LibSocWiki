*Not to be confused with the [General Confederation of Labour in
France](General_Confederation_of_Labour_(France).md "wikilink")*

The **General Confederation of Labor** (**CGT**) is a
[federation](Confederation.md "wikilink") of
[anarcho-syndicalist](Anarcho-Syndicalism.md "wikilink") [trade
unions](Trade_Union.md "wikilink") in [Spain](Spain.md "wikilink"). Formed in
[1979](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Southern_Europe.md "wikilink")
after a split from the
[CNT](National_Confederation_of_Labour_(Spain).md "wikilink"), it has over
100,000 members and represents 2,000,000 workers across Spain (a country
of 47,000,000).

## History

During the [Second Spanish
Revolution](Second_Spanish_Revolution.md "wikilink") in 1975, Spain turned
itself around from a [fascist](Fascism.md "wikilink") dictatorship into a
new [liberal democracy](Liberalism.md "wikilink"). But during this
transition, the [anarchist](Anarchism.md "wikilink") movement (once the
most powerful in the world) began to rebuild itself. The
[CNT](National_Confederation_of_Labour_(Spain).md "wikilink") quickly
re-emerged, gaining hundreds of thousands of members. But tensions began
to emerge over the question of whether or not to participate in
state-backed union elections, which would make the union eligible for
government subsidies. Combined with harassment from the police and
attacks in the Spanish media, the union felt under pressure, and
eventually split into two different unions. The faction in favour of
government subsidies and participation in union would become the
CGT.[^1]
