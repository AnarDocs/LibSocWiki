The **Paris Commune**was a two-month long [radical socialist and
revolutionary
government](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Societies "wikilink") that
ruled Paris, [France](France "wikilink") in
[1871](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Western_Europe "wikilink").

## Crime

According to Marx, crime was virtually absent in the commune, stating:

> in fact, for the first time since the days of [February
> 1848](French_Revolution_of_1848 "wikilink"), the streets of Paris were
> safe,and that without any [police](police "wikilink") of any kind.“We
> hear no longer of assassination, theft, and personal assault; it seems
> indeed as if the police had dragged along with it to Versailles all
> its Conservative friends.” Said a member of the Commune[^1]

## Economics

The Commune abolished night work for bakers, prohibited employers from
making their workers pay fines, and required owners of closed factories
to hand over the buildings to workers to be reopened as cooperatives. In
total, the Commune set up forty-three [worker
cooperatives](Worker_Cooperative "wikilink"). The Commune also opened up
several schools, including one for women.

## Notable Participants
