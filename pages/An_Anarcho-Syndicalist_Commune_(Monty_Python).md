**An Anarcho-Syndicalist Commune** is a [fictional libertarian socialist
community](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Societies#Fictional "wikilink")
in medieval Britain in the film *[Monty Python and the Holy
Grail](Monty_Python_and_the_Holy_Grail_(Film) "wikilink")*.

## Decision-Making

Unlike other medieval communities, an anarcho-syndicalist commune is an
autonomous collective that doesn't have a lord (the nearby castle being
uninhabited). Dennis describes their decision-making process as follows:

> We take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the
> week, but all the decisions of that officer have to be ratified at a
> special bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely
> internal affairs, but by a two-thirds majority in the case of purely
> external affairs.[^1]

## Economics

The community seems to mainly centered around
[farming](Agriculture "wikilink"), presumbly run according to the
principles of [workers'
self-management](Workers'_Self-Management "wikilink"). Living standards
are notably better than some of the surrounding communities, that are
often filled with poo running through the streets.

## Culture

The community is strongly skeptical of the authoritarian desires of King
Arthur, and is not subject to the [tyranny of the
majority](Tyranny_of_the_Majority "wikilink") through witch hunts or
constant lying in other communities.

## Notable Residents

- [Dennis](Dennis_(Monty_Python) "wikilink")
- Woman
