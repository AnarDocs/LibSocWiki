The **Department of Social Security Work-In** was an episode of
[workers' control](Workers'_Self-Management "wikilink") in
[Australia](Australia "wikilink") in
[1980](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Oceania "wikilink").
White-collar workers organized in the Administrative and Clerical
Officers’ Association who were employed in the federal [Department of
Social Security](Welfare_State "wikilink") staged a series of
[work-ins](Work-In "wikilink"). In 1980, they decided against a
“traditional work-in” and instead backed up their demand for improved
staffing levels by refusing—for more than two years—to recover
overpayments made to social security recipients, which cost the federal
government many millions of dollars.[^1]
