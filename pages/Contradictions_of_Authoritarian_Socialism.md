title: Contradictions of Authoritarian Socialism

This article outlines the **contradictions of authoritarian or state
socialism**, or the ways in which [authoritarian
socialist](Authoritarian_Socialism.md "wikilink") governments contradict
their own values. As such, this article takes repression of dissenters,
restrictions on media and movement, war crimes, invasion of other
countries to protect socialist revolution and spying on citizens as
justified. Even if as libertarian socialists, we have our own critiques
of these concepts.

## Why do this?

It might seem strange for us first worlders (given that most internet
users are in the first world, and libsoc wiki is an online project) to
critique third world efforts at socialism whilst under siege from the
United States. While we want all embargoes, US state-sponsored terrorism
(as seen in Cuba and China) wars and espionage to end and oppose war
against any of these countries or any other country not aligned with the
USA (like [Iran](Iran.md "wikilink") or Syria) We are obviously aware that
these critiques won't reach the people living in these countries, but
that isn't our goal. We are not trying to promote US-sponsored 'regime
change' anywhere nor are we trying to incite a libertarian socialist
revolution in any of these countries (although we'd all like to see one)
our goal is to reach Anglosphere leftists who want to recreate a
government similar to that of Cuba in their own countries. We believe
that Marxist-Leninists are responsible for a significant amount of
misinformation online about the nature of these countries, we aim to
offer a purely negative counter. If you would like to see the positive
achievements of state socialism, the page for each individual country
contains a list of positive and negative achievements.

## China

- Xi Jinping, current Premier of [China](China.md "wikilink"), has admitted
  that the country has a massive problem with corruption and has begun
  an anti-corruption campaign. The campaign 'netted' over 120
  high-ranking officials, including about a dozen high-ranking military
  officers, several senior executives of state-owned companies, and five
  national leaders. More than 100,000 people have been indicted for
  corruption.[^1]
  - The [Wukan Uprising](Wukan_Land_Defense_(2011).md "wikilink") in 2011
    highlights just how deep this corruption goes, and that the Chinese
    government often sold off peasant lands without their consent to
    wealthy corporations.
  - *Duowei* (a pro-China newspaper in the USA) wrote in support of the
    campaign, arguing China in the previous decades was heavily
    challenged by widespread corruption, a widening gap between rich and
    poor, social injustice, and excessive focus on material wealth.[^2]
- China has a pretty bad record on foreign policy. *We won't be covering
  China's debt deals and infrastructure buying. To China's credit, it is
  MUCH more peaceful than the [USA's](US_Hegemony.md "wikilink"),
  [UK's](UK_Hegemony.md "wikilink") and
  [France's](French_Hegemony.md "wikilink") efforts to create hegemony.*
  - From 1974, China (along with the USA) supported Eritrean ML rebels
    against Socialist Ethiopia.
  - In 1975, China (with the USA and France) provided material support
    for anti-communist rebels in the Angolan Civil War that tried to
    overthrow the [socialist
    government](Socialist_Angola.md "wikilink").[^3]
  - China tried to invade Vietnam in 1979, RIGHT after Vietnam had
    suffered brutally at the hands at the USA in the [Vietnam
    War](Vietnam_War.md "wikilink"). Border skirmishes continued until 1991
    where relations were normalised.[^4]
  - China ended support for the Communist Party of the Philippines in
    their insurgency in 1976 as part of its normalisation of relations
    with the Philippines.
  - China tried to invade Vietnam in 1979, RIGHT after Vietnam had
    suffered brutally at the hands at the USA in the [Vietnam
    War](Vietnam_War.md "wikilink"). Border skirmishes continued until 1991
    where relations were normalised.[^5]
  - China, along with the USA and UK, also supported Pol Pot as they
    waged a war against Vietnam and socialist Cambodia.[^6]
  - Since 1992, China has been closely cooperative with
    [Israel](Israel.md "wikilink") on military matters.[^7]
  - Since 2003, China has supported the government of Sudan whilst
    carrying out anti-Arab ethnic cleansing and mass rape.[^8]
  - Since 2005, China has aided the old Nepalese government against
    *Maoist* rebels by donating military aid to the government and
    arresting Maoists smuggling in weapons from China.[^9]
  - In the 2010s, Chinese state-owned companies invested in gas
    pipelines in [Canada](Canada.md "wikilink") over indigenous lands
    without the consent of indigenous people, leading to protests.[^10]

## Cuba

*Given that [Cuba](Cuba.md "wikilink") and its supporters often claim to be
[one of the most democratic countries in the
world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aMsi-A56ds&t), we are going to
include critiques based in media freedom and political repression, as
media freedom is an important component of democracy.*

- [Che's Guevara's](Che_Guevara.md "wikilink") grandson, [Canek Sánchez
  Guerara](Canek_Sánchez_Guerara.md "wikilink"), said of the country: “The
  [Cuban revolution](Cuban_Revolution.md "wikilink") has given birth to a
  bourgeoisie, to repressive apparatuses meant to defend from the people
  a bureaucracy very distant from that same people. But above all it has
  been anti-democratic because of the religious messianism of [its
  leader](Fidel_Castro.md "wikilink")”. He was disgusted by “the
  criminalisation of difference, the means of persecution of
  homosexuals, hippies, free thinkers, trade unionists and poets” and
  the installation of “a socialist bourgeoisie…falsely proletarian”.
  Commenting on changes in Cuba some time before his death Canek noted:
  "Sometimes we tend to judge reality from our desires, and that's a
  problem. I would like to see changes in Cuba, but that is not
  happening. In the collective imagination of Cuba, change is associated
  with the death of Fidel Castro. The political system on the island has
  behaved like a monarchy, and Fidel has ensured a monitoring of the
  succession, and that delays any change." He rejected the role that the
  regime were preparing for him as a high ranking military officer and
  lived most of his life in [Mexico](Mexico.md "wikilink"), where he died
  in 2015 after heart surgery.[^11]
- In January 2020, a former high ranking judge in Cuba (a communist and
  huge fan of Castro) leaked secret Cuban government documents that
  showed the regime had the highest incarceration rate in the world at
  over 90,000 prisoners, with thousands in prison on dubious charges.
  Documents reviewed by the New York Times showed 92% of individuals
  tried in the country are found guilty. Nearly 4,000 every year are
  accused of being "antisocial" or "dangerous", which are terms used by
  the government to charge those that have committed no crime but are
  viewed by the regime as a risk to the status quo. Those charges have a
  99.5% conviction rate. These individuals face summary trials with no
  right to a defense or to present evidence, according to the former
  judge. The documents show individuals being sentenced for several
  years in prison under the category of "anti-social", which can include
  actions like not belonging to state associated civic organizations or
  being unemployed. The crime "description" is often identical,
  appearing to be copy and pasted by police.[^12]
- According to Reporters Without Borders, Cuba is one of the worst
  places for media freedom in the world. They claim: "Cuba has continued
  year after year to be Latin America’s worst media freedom violator ...
  The regime maintains an almost total media monopoly and the
  constitution prohibits privately-owned media. The few Cuban bloggers
  and independent journalists are threatened by the government and
  watched by security agents, who often take them in for questioning and
  delete information in their devices. Journalists regarded as
  especially troublesome are often arrested and jailed. The authorities
  also control the coverage of foreign reporters by granting
  accreditation selectively and expelling those regarded as too
  “negative” about the government."[^13]
- The Cuban government allows [Israeli](Israel.md "wikilink") businesses to
  operate in the country, and [Fidel Castro](Fidel_Castro.md "wikilink")
  said in 2010 he believes Israel has a right to exist.[^14] (Note, both
  East Germany and North Korea severed ties with Israel, so it's not a
  survival thing)

## East Germany

- [In 1953](East_German_Uprising.md "wikilink"), the government repressed
  striking construction workers who protested harsh working
  conditions.[^15]

## North Korea

- North Korea has [continuously been
  abducting](North_Korean_Abductions.md "wikilink") [South
  Korean](South_Korea.md "wikilink") and [Japanese](Japan.md "wikilink")
  citizens throughout its existence.[^16][^17]
- North Korea has a strong problem with human trafficking, the
  government essentially sells workers to countries like
  [Russia](Russia.md "wikilink") and [Qatar](Qatar.md "wikilink") and there is
  a huge problem with women being trafficked as sex slaves into
  China.[^18]
- Since 1990, at least 18 North Korean diplomats have been caught
  smuggling rhino horn and ivory, though the real number is considered
  to be much higher.[^19]
- In a 2014 UN report, Syria, Myanmar, Eritrea, Tanzania, Ethiopia,
  Somalia and Iran were all suspected to have bought weapons from North
  Korea.[^20]

## Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)

- From 1930 to 1952, the [USSR](USSR.md "wikilink") pursued a number of
  policies of forced resettlement and deportations of entire ethnic
  groups based on [racist](Racism_in_the_USSR.md "wikilink") propaganda.
  This included the populations of the Azerbaijanis in Armenia, Balkars,
  Chechens, Chinese, Estonians, Finns, Germans, Greeks, Inguish, Jews,
  Kalmyks, Karachays, Latvians, Lithuanians, Poles, Romanians, Tatars,
  Turks and Ukrainians. This occured despite the USSRs officially
  condemnation of nationalism and proclaimed internationalism, including
  the right of nations and peoples to self-determination.[^21] (Note,
  apologists will try to claim that this was due to [World War
  II](World_War_II.md "wikilink"), despite several of these not occurring
  during World War II, be wary.)
- In 1933, the USSR recriminalised homosexuality between men after most
  of the medical community recommended viewing homosexuality as a normal
  and healthy thing.[^22]
- In 1938, a [pedophile and rapist](Lavrentiy_Beria.md "wikilink") was made
  head of the secret police by Stalin.[^23]
- In 1956, the government murdered several Marxist-Leninist students who
  were peacefully protesting government policies.[^24]
- In 1962, the government [repressed striking factory
  workers](Novocherkassk_Massacre_(1962).md "wikilink") who wielded banners
  of [Lenin](Vladimir_Lenin.md "wikilink") by killing around 20 of
  them.[^25]

## Vietnam

- In 1989, Le Quang Dao, a member of the Central Committee of the Party
  and the President of the National Assembly (also Vice Chairman of the
  State Council of Vietnam (1987–1992) and a general of the Vietnam
  People's Army during the Vietnam War) declared: “The dictatorship of
  the party has replaced the dictatorship of the working people as a
  whole … the result is a totalitarian regime based on privilege … a
  regime of social injustice that is driving the people to revolt.”[^26]

<!-- -->

- In November 1991, Bui Tin, the editor of <em>Nhan Dan</em>, the organ
  of the Central Committee of the Party, while on a mission to Paris,
  broke with Hanoi's previous silence on the issue and provided
  testimony concerning the political and economic crisis in his country:
  “The current situation of the country is of great concern to everyone
  in Vietnam…. Bureaucratism, irresponsibility, egoism, corruption and
  fraud have spread under the insolent reign of privileges and
  prerogatives. What is still deeply and firmly rooted in the Communist
  Party of Vietnam, is Stalinist and Maoist tendencies that are
  simultaneously feudal and peasant-based, idealistic, paternalistic and
  authoritarian, extremely conservative and corrupt, completely alien to
  democratic ideas”[^27]
