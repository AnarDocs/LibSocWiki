The **resource curse**, also known as the **paradox of plenty**, refers
to the paradox that countries with an abundance of natural resources
(such as fossil fuels and certain minerals), tend to have less economic
growth, less democracy, and worse development outcomes than countries
with fewer natural resources. There are many theories and much academic
debate about the reasons for, and exceptions to, these adverse outcomes

having never suffered a dictatorship (unlike [Cuba](Cuba "wikilink"),
Haiti, Dominican Republic and Grenada)
