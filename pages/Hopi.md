The **Hopi** (*Hopituh Shi-nu-mu -*"The Peaceful People" or "Peaceful
Little Ones")are an indigenous, [agricultural](Agriculture "wikilink")
people in present-day "[Arizona](United_States_of_America "wikilink")"
with a tradition of egalitarianism, [gender
equality](Gender_Equality "wikilink"), [common
ownership](Commons "wikilink") and
[anarcho-communist](Anarcho-Communism "wikilink") economics.

## Decision-Making

Each village was autonomous and determined its social and ceremonial
organization according to its own interpretation of clan migration
traditions.[^1] Households [confederated](Confederation "wikilink") into
clans, clans into phatries, phatries into villages and villages into
Mesas. There are thirteen villages and three Mesas.[^2]

## Crime

[Violence](Violence "wikilink") and [crime](crime "wikilink") was
extremely rare in Hopi society.[^3] [Peter
Gelderloos](Peter_Gelderloos "wikilink") describes an interesting system
of [restorative justice](Restorative_Justice "wikilink"):

> The Hopi of southwestern North America used to be more warlike than in
> recent times. Factions still exist within Hopi villages, but they
> overcome conflict through cooperation in rituals, and they use shame
> and leveling mechanisms with people who are boastful or domineering.
> When disputes get out of hand, they use ritual clown skits at
> <em>kachina</em> dances to mock the people involved. The Hopi offer an
> example of a society that gave up feuding and developed rituals to
> cultivate a more peaceful disposition. The image of clowns and dances
> being used to solve disputes gives a tantalizing glimpse of humor and
> art as means for responding to common problems. There is a world of
> possibilities more interesting than general assemblies or mediation
> processes! Artistic conflict resolution encourages new ways of looking
> at problems, and subverts the possibility of permanent mediators or
> meeting facilitators gaining power by monopolizing the role of
> arbiter.[^4]

## Economy

The Hopi practiced a form of
[anarcho-communism](Anarcho-Communism "wikilink") rooted in [common
ownership](Commons "wikilink") and a[gift
economy](Gift_Economy "wikilink"). The traditional society of the Hopi
was geared entirely toward group solidarity. Nearly all the basic tasks
of the community, from planting to food preparation, were [done
cooperatively](Workers'_Self-Management "wikilink"). Together with the
adults, [children participated](Childrearing "wikilink") in most of
these tasks. At every age level, the individual was charged with a sense
of responsibility for the community.[^5]

## Culture

Hopi legend suggests that god is the 'Spider Grandmother' who had
overseen humanity's emergence from the past three previous realms into
the current world. It left humanity with two rules:

1.  Don't go around hurting eachother
2.  Try to understand things[^6]

Hopi culture also had a strongly anti-authoritarian, communal and
ecological dimension to it.

## Collapse

The US government destroyed Hopi autonomy in 1890, as the Dawes Act
forcibly imposed [private property](Private_Property "wikilink") onto
their lands.[^7] In 1934, the US forced a tribal government onto them
made up of religious converts, who leased their lands to mining
companies who profited from [coal, natural gas](Fossil_Fuel "wikilink")
and metal extraction. This dispossessed the Hopi and polluted the
land.[^8]
