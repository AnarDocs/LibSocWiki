**Abortion** is a controversial [medical
procedure](Healthcare.md "wikilink"), involving terminating a pregnancy
before the child is born. [Libertarian
Socialists](Libertarian_Socialism.md "wikilink") (who tend to overlap with
[feminism](feminism.md "wikilink")) are usually strong supporters of rights
to abortion. The abortion debate involves whether or not it is ethical
to get an abortion, and is considered a fundamental issue in
[reproductive rights](Reproductive_Rights.md "wikilink").
