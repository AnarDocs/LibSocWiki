*Not to be confused with the Ukrainian [organisation of the same
name](Autonomous_Workers'_Union_(Ukraine) "wikilink").*

The **Autonomous Workers' Union** (APC) is an
[anarcho-syndicalist](Anarcho-Syndicalism "wikilink") organisation based
in [Bulgaria](Bulgaria "wikilink"). This group frequently acts in
solidarity with workers' from [Turkey](Turkey "wikilink"),
[Ukraine](Ukraine "wikilink") and [Russia](Russia "wikilink"), as well
as Bulgarian immigrant workers in other countries. On the 8th of March,
2015, the APC [picketed](Picketing "wikilink") a nightclub in Varna that
had not paid its workers.[^1] On the 5th of September, 2017, 150 members
of the APC protested outside the Bulgarian parliament in Sofia, calling
for harsher action on wage theft.[^2]
