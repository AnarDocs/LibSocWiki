The **Black Panther Party** (**BPP**), originally the **Black Panther
Party for Self-Defense**, was a black nationalist and
[marxist-leninist](Marxist-Leninism.md "wikilink") organisation active in
the [USA](United_States_of_America.md "wikilink"),
[UK](United_Kingdom.md "wikilink") and [Algeria](Algeria.md "wikilink") from
[1966 to
1982](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_North_America.md "wikilink").
They organised armed patrols that monitored police officers as well as a
variety of community social programs, most extensively the Free
Breakfast for Children Programs, to address issues like food injustice,
and community health clinics for education and [treatment of
diseases](Healthcare.md "wikilink") including sickle cell anemia,
tuberculosis, and later HIV/AIDS. The organisation went into decline as
members became disillusioned with its marxist-leninst politics,
repression by the [FBI](Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation.md "wikilink")
through [COINTELPRO](COINTELPRO.md "wikilink") and involvement in the drug
trade.

## History

### Background

The USA had witnessed large migrations of its black population from the
south into cities during [World War II](World_War_II.md "wikilink") as
people sought to escape poverty and racism for high-paying factory jobs
in the 1940s. These jobs weren't really there, and state-enforced
discrimination pushed many black people into ghettos with bad housing,
bad schools and almost no opportunity to escape. Additionally, the civil
rights movement led to legal gains for equality but failed to fairly
distribute political and economic power to the black population, leading
many to become disillusioned with nonviolent activism as a new
generation of black revolutionaries began to figure out new forms of
activism.
