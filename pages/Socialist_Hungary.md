## Analysis

### Positives

- According to a report from the *US Military*, there massive
  improvements in health in Socialist Hungary. "In comparison with
  pre-war standards, the average citizen received far better healthcare
  and social assistance as a result of the government's policy." in
  addition "In the 1980s, the availability of physicians, nurses, and
  hospital beds was high by international standards. In 1986 the country
  had 31,154 physicians, or about one physician per 299 inhabitants (up
  from one physician per 909 inhabitants in 1950, one per 637
  inhabitants in 1960, one per 439 inhabitants in 1970, and one per 398
  inhabitants in 1974). The country had 100 hospital beds per 10,000
  inhabitants (up from 55.8 beds per 10,000 inhabitants in 1950, 71.1 in
  1960, and 85.5 in 1974). The country had 3,801 dentists and dental
  surgeons, 43,579 nurses, 57,277 other health personnel, and 4,506
  pharmacists.[^1]
- One poll has found the population looks at the experience with more
  positivity than current Hungary. "A remarkable 72% of Hungarians say
  that most people in their country are actually worse off today
  economically than they were under communism. Only 8% say most people
  in Hungary are better off, and 16% say things are about the same. In
  no other Central or Eastern European country surveyed did so many
  believe that economic life is worse now than during the communist
  era."[^2]

### Negatives

- The health system stagnated in the 1980s and saw several major errors.
  To quote the US Military report on their healthcare mentioned in
  positives: "In the 1980s, the public engaged in much frank and
  apparently uncensored discussion about serious shortcomings in
  healthcare. Complaints concerned the aging of hospital facilities, the
  disrepair of their equipment, the shortages of basic medications, and
  the inadequate training of low-paid medical personnel. Western
  analysts estimated that Hungary spent 3.3 percent of its gross
  national product specifically on health service (the 6 percent figure
  listed in most statistical data actually included some social
  services). This percentage was the lowest of any East European country
  except Romania (in comparison, the United States spent 11 percent of
  GNP on healthcare). Critics judged the health system to be
  sub-standard, unreliable, and increasingly tainted by the practice of
  offering gratuities to medical personnel to ensure quality care. They
  warned that the achievements of past years were jeopardized by the
  current neglect. In addition, the infant mortality rate remained among
  the highest for industrialized countries with developed health
  systems.[^3]
- The country had major issues with an unusually high amount of mental
  illnesses, suicides, alcoholism and drug abuse. This has been
  connected with feelings of alienation and stresses over the
  economy.[^4]
