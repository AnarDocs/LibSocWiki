**Egged Transport Ltd** is a company that operates buses in
[Israel](Israel.md "wikilink"), [Bulgaria](Bulgaria.md "wikilink") and
[Poland](Poland.md "wikilink"). It was formerly a [worker
cooperative](Worker_Cooperative.md "wikilink"). Egged provides about 35% of
Israel's public [transport](Transportation.md "wikilink") services, employs
about 6,500 workers and operates a fleet of 2,950 buses. Egged buses
transport about 900,000 passengers per day. It was created from the
merger of four smaller worker cooperatives that provided bus services in
[1933](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Western_Asia.md "wikilink").

From 1933 to 2019, it was a worker cooperative. Until members voted to
convert it to a capitalist company to avoid various sanctions from the
Israeli government.

Egged has faced criticism for aiding the Israeli government during
wartime.
