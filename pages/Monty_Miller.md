**Montague David "Monty" Miller**was an
[IWW](Industrial_Workers_of_the_World "wikilink") activist and
[anarchist](Anarchism "wikilink").

## Life

Born in what is now Tasmania, [Australia](Australia "wikilink"), his
family immigrated to Port Phillip Bay (now containing Melbourne and
Geelong) in a whaling ship and his parents began work in the whaling
industry. When gold was discovered in Ballarat in the 1840s, his family
left for the mines and he became apprenticed as a carpenter at only 10
years old, working until he was 17. He participated in the [Eureka
Rebellion](Eureka_Rebellion_(1854) "wikilink") and was permanently
scarred by the action with bayonet and bullet wounds. He vowed to be an
enemy of the state for the rest of his life.

He had many jobs, working as a farmer in Gippsland, logger, cook and got
married at 21 to a 17 year old woman who he stayed married to for 45
years. He liked to read [Shelley](Percy_Shelley "wikilink") and moved to
Melbourne, working as a builder and carpenter, and worked tirelessly to
establish relief depots for the hungry during the [Long
Depression](Long_Depression "wikilink") and [Maritime
Strike](Australian_Maritime_Strike_(1890) "wikilink"). He quit being a
builder as he refused to subject those under him to long hours, he had
an accident while working at 77 and spent weeks in hospital. He became a
pensioner after this but continued to build houses.

He became an [atheist](Atheism "wikilink") from an early age and later a
[feminist](Feminism "wikilink"), he came in contact with exiled
[Chartists](Chartism "wikilink") at a young age. He preached on the
banks on the Yarra River to value of freedom of thought and socialism.
He often debated university graduates and any money he got from debates
he gave away. He also helped the early [Labor
Party](Labor_Party_(Australia) "wikilink") by advocating for him
(although they eventually betrayed him). Many capitalists tried to bribe
him to get him to stop but he refused to. He joined the
[IWW](Industrial_Workers_of_the_World "wikilink") as an old man, and was
later arrested for it by the Labor Party for speaking out against the
[First World War](World_War_I "wikilink"), his opposition to
[conscription](conscription "wikilink"), his support for the [Easter
Rising](Easter_Rising_(1916) "wikilink") in Ireland and his membership
in the IWW (essentially, freedom of speech and association). He helped
set up the [Melbourne Anarchist
Club](Melbourne_Anarchist_Club "wikilink") and hated the IWW split
between [anarcho-syndicalists](Anarcho-Syndicalism "wikilink") and
[DeLeonists](DeLeonism "wikilink").[^1]
