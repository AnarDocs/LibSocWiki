The **Taiping Revolution**(also called the **Taiping Rebellion** or
**Taiping Civil War**) was an effort by radical christians to establish
a theocratic, totatlirain, proto-socialist society in
[China](China.md "wikilink") from [1851 to
1864](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Eastern_Asia.md "wikilink"). The
revolution failed, killing tens of millions of people and further
leading to the weakening of the Chinese state, and increased power of
foreign empires like the British, French and USA.
