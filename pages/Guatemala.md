From 1960 to 1996, Guatemala was more or less destroyed by a brutal
civil war between leftist rebels (supported by the poor and indigenous
population) and the military (supported by the US and multinational
corporations). Between 140,000 and 200,000 people were killed in
numerous [crimes against humanity](Crimes_Against_Humanity.md "wikilink"),
the war came to an end officially in 1996 after a long peace process.
