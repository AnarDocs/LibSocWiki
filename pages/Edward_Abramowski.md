**Józef Edward Abramowski** (1868 - 1918) was a
[psychologist](Psychology.md "wikilink"),
[sociologist](Sociology.md "wikilink"), [ethical
philosopher](Philosophy.md "wikilink") and
[anarcho-syndicalist](Anarcho-Syndicalism.md "wikilink"). He helped
organised [cooperatives](Cooperative.md "wikilink") in Poland and was seen
as a 'spiritual leader' of [libertarian
socialism](Libertarian_Socialism.md "wikilink") in
[Poland](Poland.md "wikilink"), inspiring the [Workers' Defense
Committee](Workers'_Defense_Committee_(Poland).md "wikilink") and
[Solidarity](Solidarity_(Poland).md "wikilink").

## Life

### Youth

Edward was born to a wealthy family of [landlords](Landlord.md "wikilink")
and spent the first 11 years of his life in
[Ukraine](Ukraine.md "wikilink"). He moved to Warsaw,
[Poland](Poland.md "wikilink") in 1879 and was privately educated, becoming
increasingly interested in the philosophies of Marx, Darwin and Spencer,
as well as the ideas of socialism.

In 1885, he began physical and biological studies at the Faculty of
Natural Sciences of the Jagiellonian University in Krakow. As a student,
he organised a socialist youth group and began smuggling in illegal
left-wing books from abroad. From 1886 to 1889 he studied philosophy at
the University of Geneva. He became increasingly radical, becoming a
dedicated speaker and organiser, eventually dropping his studies. Upon
his return to Warsaw, he began to spread critiques of
[capitalism](capitalism.md "wikilink") and [private
property](Private_Property.md "wikilink"), but became alienated by the
socialists movements call for terrorism.[^1]

### Withdrawal from Socialism

In 1893, he fell into a deep depression, but began to organise
socialists in France, but soon contracted tuberculosis and went to
Switzerland for treatment. He resigned from politics as he became
increasingly cynical about [Marxism](Marxism.md "wikilink") and [trade
unions](Trade_Union.md "wikilink"), but devoted himself towards studying
psychology and sociology. He felt marxism lacked an understanding about
human subjectivity and the necessity for a change in culture before a
change in material conditions, leading him to
[anarchist](Anarchism.md "wikilink") conclusions, he returned to Warsaw in
1897 with this task.[^2]

### Return to Socialism

He began to work hard spreading his ideas throughout Poland, writing
articles, speaking and helping to organise groups and
[cooperatives](Cooperative.md "wikilink"). He also became increasingly
interested in psychology, organising the Polish Psychological
Association in 1907, and Chair of Psychology at the [University of
Warsaw](University.md "wikilink"), lecturing about experimental metaphysics
at the university.[^3]

### Death

He became increasingly sick as he aged, and became seriously ill in May
1918, dying on the 21st of June and buried in the Powązki Cemetery.[^4]
