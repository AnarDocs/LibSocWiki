The **Indonesian Occupation of East Timor** was a violent example of
modern colonialism where the New Order government in Indonesia occupied
East Timor and carried out a campaign of repression so brutal some have
considered it to be a genocide.

## Background

## Crimes Against Humanity

*Content warning: this article will discuss extreme forms of violence*

### Conscription

In 1981, the Indonesian army conscripted 80,000 East Timorese men and
children to be used as human shields against Fretilin guerillas. Many of
those conscripted died of starvation, exhaustion or were shot by
Indonesian forces for allowing guerillas to slip through.

### Economic Warfare

The military confiscated land and businesses

### Enforced Starvation

### Massacres

### Sex Slavery

Indonesian soldiers enslaved thousands of women and teenage girls and
subjected them to sexual slavery, forced marriages and random rapes.
Helicopters frequently flew around villages to abduct teenage girls who
were walking alone. Some women were chained up and sexually abused for
weeks by multiple soldiers.

### Torture

Torture methods used by the Indonesian military included rape, electric
shocks, beatings, forced ingestion of urine and feces,

## End

## International Response

### Australia

Starting under the most [left-wing
government](Whitlam_Government.md "wikilink") in Australian history,
Australia became the most enthusiastic supporter of Indonesia's
occupation internationally. Australia signed a deal with Indonesia to be
allowed to exploit East Timor's oil reserves and ignored Indonesia's
killing of Australian journalists covering the conflict. Also, East
Timorese resistance members who set up radio stations in northern
Australia were arrested and the radios destroyed. Every single
government in Australia, both Labor and Liberal, enthusiastically
supported the occupation in the name of 'stability' and 'security',
despite mass protests by Australians, including Australian [World War
II](World_War_II.md "wikilink") veterans who fought alongside East Timorese
against the [Japanese Empire](Japanese_Empire.md "wikilink"). To this day,
the Australian government has refused to investigate the death of
Australian journalists (despite saying they would) and has not issued
any kind of apology to the people of East Timor, nor arrested any of
their politicians arrested for violating the nuremberg principles.

### Canada

Canada abstained from voting in UN resolutions about East Timor, and
opposed three. The Canadian government regularly sold weapons to
Indonesia during the occupation, and in the 1990s approved over
CDN\$400Â million in exports for spare weapons parts.

### India

### Japan

### Portugal

Portugal became the strongest critic of the occupation,

The day after the invasion, Portugal cut diplomatic ties with Indonesia
and went on to support UN resolutions condemning the invasion. However,
in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Portuguese government appeared
reluctant to push the issue; American Indonesia specialist, Benedict
Anderson suggests this stemmed from uncertainty at the time over its
application to the European Community.<sup>\[207\]</sup> Portugal's
criticism mounted sharply from the mid-1980s, and due to public
pressure, the country became one of the highest profile campaigners in
international forums for East Timorese
self-determination.<sup>\[219\]</sup> Throughout the 1990s, Portugal
took part in UN-brokered mediations with Indonesia.<sup>\[220\]</sup>
