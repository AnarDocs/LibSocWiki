**Highland New Guinea** is a collection of around 200 different groups
of people with a population of several million which was untouched until
the 1930s. It was a dense [society](List_of_Societies "wikilink") with
an extremely advanced system of agriculture that was used for over
[7,000 years](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism "wikilink"), the worlds
longest experiment in [sustainable](Sustainability "wikilink") food
production.

## Decision-Making

Villages in Highland New Guinea used [village
assemblies](Democratic_Assembly "wikilink") which strove for
[consensus](consensus "wikilink"). An anthropologist visiting the are
described it as the "ultra-democratic extreme of bottom up
decision-making".[^1]

> Within each village, instead of hereditary leaders or chiefs, there
> were just individuals, called "big-men", who by force of personality
> were more influential than other individuals but still lived in a hut
> like everybody else's and still tilled a garden like anybody else's.
> Decisions were (and often still are today) reached by means of
> everybody in the village sitting down together and talking, and
> talking, and talking. The big-men couldn't give orders, and they might
> or might not succeed in persuading others to adopt their
> proposals.[^2]

These measures were highly successful despite extreme conditions. There
was a highly dense population that lacked metal tools and electricity
who were often spread out across hundreds of kilometers, the mountains
themselves were brutal, as villagers had to contend with snowstorms,
heavy rain, droughts, earthquakes, volcano eruptions and a high
population. Not only that, but their existence for seven thousand years
meant they dealt with numerous small ice ages, global droughts, volcanic
fallout, the arrival of Europeans, disease outbreaks, [climate
change](Climate_Change "wikilink") and the introduction of a population
explosion due to [modern medicine](Healthcare "wikilink") being
introduced. Yet still these communities survived.[^3] This proves that a
decentralized society can sustain itself longer than any
[state](state "wikilink") in history and exist in complex and rapidly
changing [systems](systems "wikilink").

## Economy

Villages in Highland New Guinea had no system of
[currency](Money "wikilink") nor evidence of a [centrally planned
economy](Central_Planning "wikilink"), likely making it
[anarcho-communist](Anarcho-Communism "wikilink") in nature. Using this,
they were able to sustainably exist for seven thousand years and
construct numerous housing that could fit all people, as well as [common
ownership](Commons "wikilink") of [land](land "wikilink"). When problems
like deforestation and soil loss threatened communities, there was a
very strong incentive to look for solutions to these problems and
develop new methods of agriculture to prevent them.[^4]

> When airplanes chartered by biologists and miners first flew over the
> interior in the 1930s, for the pilots to see below them a landscape
> transformed by millions of people previously unknown to the outside
> world. The scene looked like the most densely populated areas of
> [Holland](Netherlands "wikilink"): broad open valleys with few clumps
> of trees, divided as far as the eye could see into neatly laid-out
> gardens separated by ditches for irrigation and drainage, terraced
> steep hillsides reminiscent of [Java](Indonesia "wikilink") or
> [Japan](Japan "wikilink").[^5]

[Innovation](Innovation "wikilink") was also very strong in Highland New
Guinea, being one of only ten societies in the world to independently
discover [agriculture](agriculture "wikilink"). Numerous efforts to stop
[environmental destruction](Ecocide "wikilink") and agricultural
techniques so advanced and efficient that they baffled European
agronomists and [scientists](Science "wikilink") attempting to learn
from them.[^6]

## Environmental Protection

Villages in Highland New Guinea had numerous methods for protecting the
environment, which allowed them to sustainably farm and build things for
seven thousand years[^7], methods such as:

- Vertical drainage ditches to prevent flooding of gardens
- Adding weeds, grass, old vines and other organic matter to the soil to
  compost it
- Using ash, cut vegetation, rotting logs, chicken poo as mulch and
  fertilizer
- Crop rotation to keep nitrogen levels in the soil stable
- Extensive reforestation efforts to keep nitrogen stable and to ensure
  a supply of wood for fuel and construction

## Culture

People from Highland New Guinea have been described very positively by
foreign anthropologists:

> New Guineans are more curious and experimental than any other people
> that I have encountered. When in my early years in New Guinea I saw
> someone who had acquired a pencil, which was still an unfamiliar
> object then, the pencil would be tried out for a myriad purposes other
> than writing: a hair decoration? a stabbing tool? something to chew
> on? a long earring? a plug through the pierced nasal septum? Whenever
> I take New Guineans to work with me in areas away from their own
> village, they are constantly picking up local plants, asking local
> people about the plants' uses, and selecting some of the plants to
> bring back with them and try growing at home.[^8]

## Decline

With the arrival of [Nederlander](Kingdom_of_the_Nederlands "wikilink")
and [Australian](Commonwealth_of_Australia "wikilink") colonialism in
the 1930s as well as the introduction of diseases and theft of communal
land holdings for colonial use. The creation of the [independent
Indonesian state](Republic_of_Indonesia "wikilink") also led to
genocidal actions carried out against the population, including slavery,
massacres and the burning of villages. However, many villages still
remain autonomous from [states](State_(Polity) "wikilink") and the
[Papua Genocide](Papua_Genocide "wikilink").
