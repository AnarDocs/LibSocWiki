An **intentional community** is a planned residential community designed
from the start to have a high degree of social cohesion and teamwork.
The members of an intentional community typically hold a common social,
political, religious, or spiritual vision and often follow an
alternative lifestyle. They typically share responsibilities and
resources. Intentional communities include collective households,
cohousing communities, coliving, ecovillages, monasteries, communes,
survivalist retreats, [kibbutzim](kibbutzim.md "wikilink"), ashrams, and
housing cooperatives. New members of an intentional community are
generally selected by the community's existing membership, rather than
by real-estate agents or land owners (if the land is not owned
collectively by the community).
