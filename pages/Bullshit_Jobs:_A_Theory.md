**Bullshit Jobs: A Theory** is a
[book](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Media.md "wikilink") written by [David
Graeber](David_Graeber.md "wikilink") that outlines how between 30-40% of
jobs within modern [capitalist](Capitalism.md "wikilink") economies are
'bullshit'. The book explores the causes, effects and solutions to this
problem, with some interesting historical notes and philosophical
questions thrown in.

## Summary

### Chapter 1: What is a Bullshit Job?

### Chapter 2: What Sort of Bullshit Jobs Are There?

There are five major kinds of bullshit jobs.

1.  **Flunkies** are jobs that exist to make someone else look or feel
    important, such as secretaries and doormen.
2.  **Goons** are jobs which only exist because competitors have them,
    such as lobbyists, PR specialists, telemarketers and corporate
    lawyers.
3.  **Duct Tapers** are jobs which only exist because of easily fixable
    faults or inefficiencies in an organization.
4.  **Box Tickers** are jobs which exist so an organization can say it
    is doing something, without actually doing anything.
5.  **Taskmasters** are jobs which exist to assign tasks to others,
    often bullshit ones.

These are not exclusive categories, and often overlap depending on the
work being performed.
