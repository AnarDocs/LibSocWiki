**Marc Dutroux** is a [serial killer](Serial_Killer.md "wikilink") and
child molester who's been alleged to have been involved with a
[pedophile ring](Pedophile_Ring.md "wikilink") involving
[Belgian](Belgium.md "wikilink") police, politicians and businessmen.

## Evidence for a Cover-up

- Dutroux's mother wrote a letter to police alleging that he was
  planning something, and that he scared both her and her mother, but
  never received a reply.
- He was under police camera surveillance the night he kidnapped two
  girls but the police had only programmed the camera to operate during
  the daylight hours of 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
- A locksmith who was accompanying police said he heard children's
  voices coming from inside the house while the two men were in the
  basement, but the police ignored it.
- Several videotapes were seized that showed Dutroux constructing the
  secret entrance and the dungeon where the girls were then held. The
  tapes were never viewed by the police, who later claimed this was
  because they did not have a videotape player.
- Dutroux's claimed that he was part of a sex ring that included
  high-ranking members of the police force and government.
- Connerotte, a magistrate brought in to testify on corruption around
  the case broke down in tears when he described "the bullet-proof
  vehicles and armed guards needed to protect him against the shadowy
  figures determined to stop the full truth coming out."
- Police confirmed hitmen had been hired on magistrates and members of
  the criminal justice system.
- More than 20 potential witnesses of the case have died suspiciously
  with no explanation.
