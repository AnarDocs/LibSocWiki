The **Bishnoi Forest Campaign** was an early
[environmentalist](Environmentalism "wikilink") campaign in what is now
Western Rajistan, [India](India "wikilink") in
[1730](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Southern_Asia "wikilink") to
prevent deforestation, this led to a state-supported massacre of 363
nonviolent protesters.

## Background

The Bishnoi or Vishnoi faith is a [religious](Religion "wikilink")
offshoot of [Hinduism](Hinduism "wikilink") founded in 1485 by Guru
Maharaj Jambaji, it has 29 principles, they are:

    keep mother and child away from household activities.
2.  Observe 5 days' segregation while a woman is in her menses.
3.  Take bath daily in the morning before Sunrising.
4.  Obey the ideal rules of life: Modesty, Patience or satisfactions,
    cleanliness.
5.  Pray two times everyday (morning and evening).
6.  Eulogise God, Vishnu, in evening hours (Aarti)
7.  Perform Yajna (Havan) with the feelings of welfare devotion and
    love.

Notable of these are several rules promoting environmental stewardship,
forbidding the harming of trees and animals. This was based on Jambaji's
personal experience as he witnessed the cutting of trees during droughts
which made them worse, and began to realize ecosystems were highly
sensitive and interdependent, their instability having massive
consequences for humans and animals. When the local maharajah (king) of
Jodhpur wanted to build a new palace, he sent soldiers to gather wood
from the forests around Khejarli, a small villages with many Bishnois.

## Events

When the soldiers began to cut down trees, many Bishnois protested
peacefully, but were ignored by the soldiers who followed their orders.
Amrita Devi, a local villager, could not bear to witness the destruction
of both her faith and the village's sacred trees. She decided to
literally hug the trees, and encouraged others to do so too,
proclaiming: “A chopped head is cheaper than a felled tree.” Bishnois
from Khejri and nearby villages came to the forest and embraced the
trees one by one to protect them from being cut down. The soldiers
attempted to bribe the villagers, which only insulted them.[^2]

Bishnois from 83 villages began to travel to Jehnad in an attempt to
save the trees. and a council was convened to determine what could be
done about the situation. The council's decision was that each Bishnoi
volunteer would lay down their life to defend one of the threatened
trees. Older people went forward first, with many of them being killed
as they hugged the Khejris.They began to decapitate villagers who As
each villager hugged a tree, refusing to let go, they were beheaded by
the soldiers. This voluntary martyrdom continued until 363 Bishnoi
villagers were killed in the name of the sacred Khejarli forest, leading
to it becoming known as the **Kherjali Massacre**.[^3]

## Results

Upon hearing of the beheadings, the king rushed to the village and
apologized, ordering the soldiers to stop logging, and designated the
Bishnoi state as a protected area forbidding harm to trees and animals.
This legislation still exists today in the region. In memory of the 363
Bishnois, who died protecting their dear trees, a number of khejri trees
are planted around the area, which is still notably lush and rich with
animal life. The Bishnoi sacrifices became the inspiration for a much
larger [Chipko movement](Chipko_(India) "wikilink") that is still
growing today, in which villagers physically embrace trees to save them
from logging.[^4]
