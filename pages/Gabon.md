**Gabon**, officially the **Gabonese Republic** is a
[liberal](Liberalism "wikilink") and [capitalist](Capitalism "wikilink")
[state](List_of_States "wikilink") in Central Africa near [Equatorial
Guinea](Equatorial_Guinea "wikilink"), [Sao Tome and
Principe](Sao_Tome_and_Principe "wikilink"),
[Cameroon](Cameroon "wikilink") and the [Republic of the
Congo](Republic_of_the_Congo "wikilink").

## History

### Pre-Colonial History

Unfortunately, little is known about Gabon before European colonialism
except that it was settled in the 1300s by [Bantu
peoples](Bantu_Peoples "wikilink"), little is known of life then, but
tribal art suggests a rich cultural heritage.

### First Contact

The [first contact](First_Contact_(Concept) "wikilink") made between
Europeans and the Gabonese were explorers of the [Portuguese
Empire](Portuguese_Empire "wikilink") who colonised [São Tomé and
Príncipe](Sao_Tome_and_Principe "wikilink") in the late 1400s. Gabon was
used as a centre of entry for the [slave
trade](Atlantic_Slave_Trade "wikilink") and some colonisers established
themselves as rulers of some small islands and points on the coast, but
nothing really came of it. Dutch, English, and French traders came in
the 1500s.

### French Colony

In 1839, Gabon was colonised by the [French
Empire](French_Empire "wikilink"). In 1842
[American](United_States_of_America "wikilink") missionaries from New
England established a mission at the mouth of the Komo River in 1842. In
1849, the French authorities captured an illegal slave ship and freed
the captives on board. The captives were released near the mission
station, where they founded a settlement which was
called Libreville (French for "free town"). It operated as a fairly
standard colony, with a white French minority controlling most of the
wealth and it largely being used to extract natural resource and cheap
laborers for overseas markets.

### Independence

Gabon was [decolonised](Decolonisation "wikilink") in 1960 and became a
[representative democracy](Representative_Democracy "wikilink") with two
main political parties, one representing [social
democracy](Social_Democracy "wikilink") and one representing centrist
liberalism. This soon ended after a military coup in 1964 followed by
[French military intervention](Francafrique "wikilink"), by the
democracy was unstable, eventually becoming a one-party
state/dictatorship in 1968 and attempted to forge a unified national
identity as opposed to more decentralised tribal relationships.

[In 1990 a wave of uprisings and
strikes](Gabon_Uprising_(1990) "wikilink") by students and workers led
to massive wage increases, creation of a representative democracy,
introduction of freedom of assembly and press. Two coups were averted
and the government became relatively stable, becoming one of the
healthiest and wealthiest states in Africa. However, recently the
country has suffered from a military coup and a fair bit of corruption.
