**Libertarian Parenting** or **Libertarian Childrearing**refers to the
parenting strategies advocated for by [libertarian
socialists](Libertarian_Socialism "wikilink") to allow for the creation
of children who accept freedom and responsibility. The basic principles
can be summed up as follows: Get rid of authority, moralism, and the
desire to “improve” and “civilise” children. Allow them to be
themselves, without pushing them around, bribing, threatening,
admonishing, lecturing, or otherwise forcing them to do anything.
Refrain from action unless the child, by expressing their “freedom”
restricts the freedom of others and <strong>explain</strong> what is
wrong about such actions and never mechanically punish.

## Libertarian Parenting applied to stages of Parenting

Parenting can roughly be divided between infancy (ages 0 - 4) where a
child is completely dependent on the parent for food, movement,
protection and emotional well being, childhood (ages 4 - 11) where a
child begins to experiment with freedom of movement, food and develops
friendships with other children, and finally the teenager years (11 -
18) where a child begins to rapidly mature and experiment with new
freedoms, often conflicting with the parent.

### Infancy

Upon the birth of a child, it is extremely important for the parents to
establish lots of close and gentle physical contact with the child.

### Children

Children undergo a 'first puberty at around age 3 to 6, they begin to
play with their genitals and the genitals of other children their age.
This is a perfectly health, normal and natural behaviour to exhibit, and
should not be shamed in the child. This should be encouraged by the
parents and not shamed, and nakedness should never be discouraged.
Parents should present themselves as naked in a non-sexual context and
encourage the child to be naked. However, the child should be told when
he is ready to understand that some people don’t like to see children
naked and that, in the presence of such people, he should wear clothes.

In **no** situations should children be physically attacked (including
spanking or slaps) or punished with screaming, denial of toys and
electronics, shaming or isolation from the parents. These only instill a
deep sense of a cruel world in a child who is not capable of developing
a rational understanding as to why an action was wrong. This turns
children into sadists from an early age, and the development of these
sadistic drives create fertile ground for ideas of authoritarianism,
racism, war, gendered violence and violent crime.

Cross-cultural research indicates that any kind of violence against
children leads to higher rates of violence (notably domestic violence,
homicide, assault and wars) among said children later in life than
children raised in a nonviolent way.[^1] Violence against children is
one of the most common and dangerous forms of violence in modern
society, it also creates hatred of parents within the child, for
example, fantasies of the father’s death, which immediately causes
guilt, and so is repressed. Often the hatred induced by punishment
emerges in fantasies that are seemingly remote from the parents, such as
stories of giant killing - always popular with children because the
giant represents the father, a physically larger and seemingly
untouchable authority being killed. Obviously, the sense of guilt
produced by such fantasies is very advantageous to organised religions
that promise redemption from “sin.” It is surely no coincidence that
such religions are enthusiastic promoters of the sex-negative morality
and disciplinarian child rearing practices that keep supplying them with
recruits.

What is worse, however, is that punishment actually
<strong>creates</strong> “problem children.” This is so because the
parent arouses more and more hatred (and diminishing trust in other
human beings) in the child with each spanking, which is expressed in
still worse behaviour, calling for more spankings, and so on, in a
vicious circle. In contrast, <em>“The self-regulated child does not need
any punishment,”</em> Neill argues, <em>“and he does not go through this
hate cycle. He is never punished and he does not need to behave badly.
He has no use for lying and for breaking things. His body has never been
called filthy or wicked. He has not needed to rebel against authority or
to fear his parents. Tantrums he will usually have, but they will be
short-lived and not tend toward neurosis (a relatively mild mental
illness that is not caused by organic disease, involving symptoms of
stress (depression, anxiety, obsessive behaviour, hypochondria) but not
a radical loss of touch with reality)”</em>

### Teenagers

## Criticism and Responses

### Natural Goodness

### Learning Ethics

### Selfishness

### Spoiled Children

### Irrelevancy

Some would argue that these concerns, especially about sexual
liberation, are pretty small compared to other ideas like dismantling
the [state](State_(Polity) "wikilink") and
[capitalism](capitalism "wikilink") introducing [workers'
self-management](Workers'_Self-Management "wikilink") or [participatory
democracy](Democratic_Assembly "wikilink"). Many socialists would even
argue that these are distractions from class struggle and anyone who
raises these concerns might even be secret capitalists.

However, to create a society centered around freedom also means a
society centered around responsibility. This requires a mass
psychological revolution that will change people's relationship to one
another, and one key part of this will be changing how children are
raised. Most of us spend the first 18 years of our lives in perpetual
conflict with authoritarian parents (manifesting in screaming matches,
awkward silences, frustration and sometimes running away) and this
leaves people crippled psychologically for the rest of their lives and
unconsciously plants the idea in people's head that people are naturally
violent, authoritarian and selfish. Challenging authoritarian parenting
is part of a multi-faceted attack on all systems of domination and a
necessity towards building the self-managed society that libertarian
socialists desire.

If we look at the [Mujeres Libres](Mujeres_Libres "wikilink") in
[Revolutionary Spain](Revolutionary_Spain "wikilink"), "Respecting
children and educating them well was vitally important to the process of
revolutionary change. Ignorance made people particularly vulnerable to
oppression and suffering. More importantly, education prepared people
for social life. Authoritarian schools (or families), based upon fear,
prepared people to be submissive to an authoritarian government \[or
within a capitalist workplace\]. Different schools and families would be
necessary to prepare people to live in a society without
domination.”[^2]
