The **Novocherkassk Massacre** was a
[massacre](Crimes_Against_Humanity.md "wikilink") committed against
nonviolent protesters and [striking](List_of_Strikes.md "wikilink") workers
on the [2nd of June,
1962](Left-Wing_Resistance_to_Authoritarian_Socialism.md "wikilink") in the
city of Novocherkassk in the [USSR](USSR.md "wikilink") by the Red Army and
KGB. 26 people were killed by soldiers and more than 200 were arrested,
as well as 7 who were sentenced to death. The massacre was not discussed
in the media and kept as a state secret until 1992. The massacre is
commemorated each year on the anniversary of the murders by group of
survived participants of the protests.

## Background

Discontent began with the increase of prices for consumer goods,
shortages and poor working conditions. Production quotas were increased
but wages were not, leading to anger. Workers at a traincar factory
marched across the city, infront of the police station and city hall.
Strikers carried potraits of [Lenin](Vladimir_Lenin.md "wikilink") and red
flags, and were harassed by soldiers. Although tanks were sent in to
crush, the local commander refused to fire on the strikers. Strikes were
harassd by soldiers and soon attacked the police station, demanding
better working conditions, the army soon shot into the crowd, killing
dozens and soon a week-long curfew was imposed. Orders to kill were
approved by [Khrushchev](Nikita_Khrushchev.md "wikilink") himself.

## Aftermath

Following the incident, the Soviet government directed extra food
supplies to the region and began an investigation. Additional arrests of
workers followed, as did courts martial of military officials involved.
The whole story was censored by Soviet media and never allowed to any
other mass media and remained an official secret until 1992, year after
fall of the Soviet Union, when the remains of 20 bodies were recovered
and identified in 1992 and buried in the cemetery of Novoshakhtinsk.
