On April 15, 2011 a group of women and men using rocks and fireworks
attacked a busload of illegal loggers associated with the Mexican drug
cartel La Familia Michoacana and armed with machine guns. The vigilantes
assumed control over the town, expelled the police force and politicians
and blocked roads leading to oak forest on a nearby mountain which had
been subject to illegal logging by armed gangs supported by corrupt
officials.
