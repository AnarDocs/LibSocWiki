The **Strandzha Commune** or **Strandzha Republic**was a short-lived
[anarchist society](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Societies.md "wikilink")
in the [Ottoman Empire](Ottoman_Empire.md "wikilink") in what is now
[Bulgaria](Bulgaria.md "wikilink") in
[1903](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism.md "wikilink") during The St
Elijah's Day or [Ilinden-Preobrazhenie
Uprising](Ilinden-Preobrazhenie_Uprising.md "wikilink").

## Decision-Making

According to one historian righting on the subject:

> "The question of state power was never raised, and no decrees were
> issued. The population of the liberated villages nominated and elected
> not mayors and presidents, but commissioners from among their own
> number. The commissions were to administer, not to rule. Never was
> there any talk of establishing any authorities, albeit new ones. It
> was only emphasized that the "commissions" would function under the
> control of the rebel forces. This was quite natural and also a matter
> of necessity, because decisive power was now in the hands of the
> people in arms, and its fate was in its own hands.[^1]

## Economy

The economy of the Strandzha Commune was based almost entirely on
[agriculture](agriculture.md "wikilink"). [Land](Land.md "wikilink"),
livestock, salt and grain were made [common](Commons.md "wikilink") to all
people based on [anarcho-communist](Anarcho-Communism.md "wikilink")
principles. Most of the labor force was composed of women, who worked in
the farms as men became guerilla fighters. This period saw a significant
boost in the health of people as they were able to eat more.[^2]

## Culture

The now free villagers held numerous feasts, dances and festivals to
celebrate the commune.[^3]

## Collapse

The commune was destroyed as it was stormed by thousands of Ottoman
soldiers.[^4]
