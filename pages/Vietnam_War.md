The **Vietnam War** also known as the **Resistance Wars** or **Indochina
Wars** refers to a conflict between [Vietnam](Vietnam "wikilink"),
[France](France "wikilink") and the
[USA](United_States_of_America "wikilink") in their efforts to
recolonise Vietnam and turn it into an area for extracting raw
resources. The Vietnamese were successful thanks to fierce anti-colonial
resistance by the Vietnamese and mutinous US soldiers and the peace
movement.
