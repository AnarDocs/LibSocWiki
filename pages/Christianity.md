**Christianity** is the world's largest [organised
religion](Organised_Religion "wikilink"), with 2,400,000,000 followers
(or nearly a third of [Earth's](Earth "wikilink") population) and is
easily the most historically powerful. Based off the teachings of
[Jesus](Jesus "wikilink"), it uses the Bible as a guide and argues for
the following of the ten commandments.
