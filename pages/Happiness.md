## Happiness and Libertarian Socialism

Happiness is largely dependent on both negative and positive freedom.
Whether or not a [libertarian socialist
society](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Societies "wikilink") would make
people more happy is unknown, however, data and testimony provide some
clues, for example, [George Orwell](George_Orwell "wikilink") said of
[Revolutionary Spain](Revolutionary_Spain "wikilink"):

> I had dropped more or less by chance into the only community of any
> size in Western Europe where political consciousness and disbelief in
> capitalism were more normal than their opposites. Up here in AragÃ³n
> one was among tens of thousands of people, mainly though not entirely
> of working-class origin, all living at the same level and mingling on
> terms of equality. In theory it was perfect equality, and even in
> practice it was not far from it. There is a sense in which it would be
> true to say that one was experiencing a foretaste of Socialism, by
> which I mean that the prevailing mental atmosphere was that of
> Socialism. Many of the normal motives of civilized life--snobbishness,
> money-grubbing, fear of the boss, etc.--had simply ceased to exist.
> The ordinary class-division of society had disappeared to an extent
> that is almost unthinkable in the money-tainted air of England; there
> was no one there except the peasants and ourselves, and no one owned
> anyone else as his master. Of course such a state of affairs could not
> last. It was simply a temporary and local phase in an enormous game
> that is being played over the whole surface of the earth. But it
> lasted long enough to have its effect upon anyone who experienced it.
> However much one cursed at the time, one realized afterwards that one
> had been in contact with something strange and valuable. One had been
> in a community where hope was more normal than apathy or cynicism,
> where the word 'comrade' stood for comradeship and not, as in most
> countries, for humbug... Human beings were behaving as human beings
> and not as cogs in the capitalist machine.[^1]

The anthropologist Colin Turnbull, after living with a
[Mbuti](Mbuti "wikilink") band, remarked, "They were a people who had
found in the forest something that made life more than just worth
living, something that made it, with all its hardships and problems and
tragedies, a wonderful thing full of joy and happiness and free of
care."[^2]

Happiness at work through satisfaction is also important, and can be
provided by [workers'
self-management](Workers'_Self-Management "wikilink"). According to a
study drawing on a questionnaire from the population of the
[Italian](Italy "wikilink") province of Trento, [worker
cooperatives](Worker_Cooperative "wikilink") are the only form of
enterprise that fosters social trust between employees.[^3] A survey
conducted in Seoul, [South Korea](South_Korea "wikilink") suggests that
in conventional firms, the more demanding the job is, the less committed
the employees are, however, this was not the case in worker
cooperatives.[^4] In the [US](United_States_of_America "wikilink"), home
health aides in worker cooperatives were significantly more satisfied
with their jobs than in other agencies.[^5]
