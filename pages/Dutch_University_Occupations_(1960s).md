The Dutch University Occupations of the 1960s were a series of student
strikes and university occupations aiming to democratise the university
system in the [Netherlands](Netherlands "wikilink") in favour of workers
and students.

## Background

Inspired by similar movements in
[France](May_1968_Events_in_France "wikilink") and Germany, a new
student movement began aiming for the restructuring of the university
system around democratic lines. Traditionally, Dutch universities were
public and managed by the [state](State_(Polity) "wikilink"). A Board of
Curators (College van Curatoren) was responsible for upholding laws and
regulations implemented by the government over universities, maintaining
the quality of the teaching programmes, academic buildings, and
university possessions. The Curatoren also administered university
finances. Gradually the Curatorenâ€™s role shifted to become more
organizational rather than policy oriented.

A group known as the Maris committee was established to create a new
formal university structure. In 1968, the Maris committee submitted a
proposal to eliminate the current reign of dual authority between
Curatoren and Senate. Instead, they planned to introduce a hierarchical
system by which professors would report to departmental deans, and the
deans would report to a central governing board with broad power known
as the Presidium.

## Events

Angry professors (who feared losing their autonomy and the impact this
would have on research) and students (who began to fear education
becoming more capitalist). Students occupied university campuses,
telephone exchanges and threatened violent action in 1968 and 1969
against the government.
