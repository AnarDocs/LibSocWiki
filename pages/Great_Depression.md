The **Great Depression** was the worst global economic crisis in
history, beginning with a [US](United_States_of_America.md "wikilink")
stock market crash in 1929 and arguably ended in the 1940s or 1950s and
became a catalyst for the rise of [fascism](fascism.md "wikilink") and
[social democracy](Social_Democracy.md "wikilink"), leading to [World War
II](World_War_II.md "wikilink").

immigrants from the US, Finland and Germany went to the USSR seeking a
better life, leading to a massive surge of support for communism across
the world.
