The **Haudenosaunee Confederacy**("People of the Longhouse", called the
"Iroquois" by Europeans) or **Six Nations**([1142 -
1800s](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism "wikilink"))are an egalitarian
[confederation](confederation "wikilink") of six indigenous
[nations](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Societies "wikilink") (Mohawks,
Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas, Senecas and Tuscarora) in what is now
'[Canada](Canada "wikilink")' and the '[United States of
America](United_States_of_America "wikilink")'.

## Crime

The Haudenosaunee had no police, prisons and courts. Yet they had an
extremely low rate of crime, where theft, vandalism, armed robbery and
were almost unknown.[^1]

According to [Friedrich Engels](Friedrich_Engels "wikilink"), there was
a degree of [restorative justice](Restorative_Justice "wikilink")
practiced with Haudenosaunee communities practiced:

> All quarrels and disputes are settled by the whole of the community
> affected, by the gens or the tribe, or by the gentes among themselves;
> only as an extreme and exceptional measure is blood revenge
> threatened-and our capital punishment is nothing but blood revenge in
> a civilized form, with all the advantages and drawbacks of
> civilization.[^2]

## Economy

The Haudenosaunee developed and crafted an economy that could only be
described as [anarcho-commmunist](Anarcho-Communism "wikilink"). Land
and natural resources (such as forests and rivers) were [commonly
owned](Commons "wikilink") and people only owned as much as they could
[personally use](Usufruct "wikilink"). People gardened,
[farmed](Agriculture "wikilink"), fished, cleared forests, built houses,
made tools, created clothing, [raised
children](Childrearing "wikilink"), served as diplomats and hunted for
food. Mary Jemison, a European teenager who was adopted into the Seneca
nation in 1758, describes a degree of workers' self-management in the
communities:

> Our labor was not severe...In the summer season, we planted, tended
> and harvested our corn, and generally had all our children with us;
> but had no master to oversee or drive us, so that we could work as
> leisurely as we pleased.
