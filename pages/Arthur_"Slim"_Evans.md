## Life

Nothing is known about Arthur's childhood, but he left
[Toronto](Canada.md "wikilink") in 1911 and worked as a
[farmer](Agriculture.md "wikilink") and carpenter. In
[Minneapolis](United_States_of_America.md "wikilink") he became involved
with the [IWW](Industrial_Workers_of_the_World.md "wikilink"), and was shot
during the [Ludlow Massacre](Ludlow_Massacre.md "wikilink"), leading to him
walking with a limp for the rest of his life.

He returned to Canada and joined the [One Big
Union](One_Big_Union.md "wikilink"), helping to represent
[coal](Fossil_Fuels.md "wikilink") [miners](Mining.md "wikilink"). He was
arrested for five years over union activity, and became an early member
of the [Communist Party of
Canada](Communist_Party_of_Canada.md "wikilink"). During the [Great
Depression](Great_Depression.md "wikilink"), he helped organise unemployed
workers across Canada. He participated in the [On-to-Ottawa
Trek](On-to-Ottawa_Trek.md "wikilink") and [Regina
Riot](Regina_Riot.md "wikilink"), and raised funds for volunteer fighters
in the [Spanish Civil War](Spanish_Civil_War.md "wikilink").

He was killed after being hit by a car in Vancouver, 1944.[^1]
