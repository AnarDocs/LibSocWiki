**Electricity** or **Electric Power** is the manipulation of electric
charges for human purposes, such as lighting, heating and enabling the
use of complex machinery. Someone who works on these manipulations is
called an electrician or sparky.

## Electric Power Generation Methods

### Biofuel

### Coal

### Hydro

Hydroelectric power, or water power in general, involves taking
advantage of water that has been raised due to evaporation by the sun,
and deposited on high ground. As it then flows back towards the ocean,
its potential energy can be tapped by turbines or water wheels, which
are usually built into dams to increase the drop.

Advantages include:

- It's by far the cheapest source of energy. At less than a third the
  cost of fossil fuels.
- It is relatively clean, once the equipment has been built and
  installed
- The technology is relatively simple and very robust, meaning it
  doesn't require anywhere close to the maintenance and knowledge base
  required for, say, a nuclear plant.
- If you need a flood control dam it is very cheap and low impact to add
  electricity generators to it (at least compared with leaving the dam
  without turbines)
- Creation of artificial lakes upstream of the dams, to be used for
  recreation, wildlife preserves, or potable water supplies
- Can slow erosion, such as the case of Niagara Falls, where the falls
  are "turned off" when the tourists aren't watching and diverted to the
  hydro plant
- Supplies power on demand (actually about the most responsive power
  source on any grid)
- Doesn't need significant electricity or power to start, making it
  useful for black starts.
- By installing pumps that return water upstream, the dam can act like a
  gigantic battery - in fact this is the cheapest most reliable and most
  efficient large scale energy storage in existence. This is
  incidentally one of the major uses for artificial lakes in the Alpine
  countries and Scandinavia.
- The only renewable proven to be able to take significant market share
  away from fossil fuels
- Old mine shafts can be used as reservoirs for pump based water power
  (primarily used for energy storage)

Disadvantages include:

- Flooding of landscapes, causing a disruption of ecosystems.
- Displacement of residents and burial underwater of important cultural
  landmarks.
- Limited by geography. In most developed countries, all the good spots
  are already taken.
- The flooded vegetation and soil decomposes anaerobically to methane, a
  far worse greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. which causes further
  global warming. Of course cutting down trees before flooding and
  similar measures can somewhat reduce that, but it is rarely done.
- The failure of a dam can be disastrous. Large dam failures rank among
  the most deadly industrial accidents in history.
- Dams are targets for military or terrorist activity.
- Hydroelectric dams pose barriers to migrating fish. This can be
  remedied to some extent by constructing fish ladders.
- As any Geo-scientist worth their salt will tell you: Artificial lakes
  tend to silt up. Depending on the amount of sediment the river brings
  from upstream, this can be an alarmingly rapid process (as is the case
  with Lake Nasser on the Nile) or hardly perceptible on human
  timescales. Eventually the river "wants to" fill up all artificial
  lakes to the level of the dam.
- Large mostly stagnant bodies of water can be breeding grounds for
  mosquitoes and other bugs. Mosquitoes are vector for some of the
  deadliest diseases known to humanity, including Malaria, Dengue (for
  which neither cure nor vaccine exists), Yellow fever, Zika or West
  Nile.
- The sheer weight of the water in a reservoir may have an effect on
  earthquakes and possibly the rotation of the Earth itself.

### Geothermal

### Natural Gas

### Nuclear

### Oil

It is possible to get electricity from oil by

### Piezo

### Solar

### Thermo

### Tidal

### Waste

### Wind

Although only 3% of the world's power comes from the wind, some European
countries produce a lot more. The heaviest user is Denmark at 39% in
2014, followed by Spain's 11.5% in 2009 (and 40% on a good day).
