The **Zapatista Revolution**(commonly known as the **Zapatista
Uprising** or **Chiapas Uprising**) was an [armed
revolution](Revolution.md "wikilink") in
[1994](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism.md "wikilink") that triggered both
the [Chiapas Conflict](Chiapas_Conflict.md "wikilink") and the formation of
the [Rebel Zapatista Autonomous
Municipalities](Rebel_Zapatista_Autonomous_Municipalities.md "wikilink").
It was fought between the [Zapatista Army of National
Liberation](Zapatista_Army_of_National_Liberation.md "wikilink") (EZLN) and
the Mexican [military](military.md "wikilink").

## Background

The Spanish [colonization](Colonialism.md "wikilink") of
[Mexico](Mexico.md "wikilink") led to [genocide](genocide.md "wikilink") of
[indigenous people](Indigenous_People.md "wikilink") and the
[expropriation](Privatisation.md "wikilink") of [communal indigenous
land](Commons.md "wikilink"). Although the indigenous led many uprisings
and guerilla wars against the Spanish colonizers, they largely failed
due to inferior military technology, genocidal tactics used by the
Spanish army and the destruction of communities due to diseases. Upon
Mexico's independence from [Spain](Spain.md "wikilink"), exploitation of
indigenous communities and labor intensified.[^1]

During the Mexican Revolution (1910 - 1920), several guerilla leaders
like [Emilio Zapata](Emilio_Zapata.md "wikilink") advocated the creation of
autonomous indigenous nations in Southern Mexico and stressed the need
for common ownership of land. Although he was killed, he inspired
numerous activists and rebels over the next hundred years. The new
dictatorship which came out of the Mexican Revolution further
exploited.[^2]

In 1983, in response to massacres of students protesting the Mexican
dictatorship, six people in Chiapas became rebels and formed the EZLN.
Training for guerilla warfare in jungle camps, holding reading groups
and spreading revolutionary propaganda among the impoverished population
of Chiapas.[^3] The turning point for much of the population was the
signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which would
see indigenous land be handed over to private companies, increased
income inequality and destruction of ecosystems.[^4]

## Events

December 1993: EZLN guerilla camps in the Lacandon Jungle are raided by
the Mexican military. In response, the First Declaration of the Lacandon
Jungle is announced, declaring the Mexican state illegitmate and the
right for indigenous people to form their own nations, as well as the
need for common ownership of land.

1st of January 1994: As NAFTA goes into effect, EZLN seizes seven towns
in Chiapas, burning down police stations after stealing guns and
government buildings, barricading the streets and freeing political
prisoners.

2nd of January 1994: The Mexican military begins to counter-attack, the
EZLN kidnaps the governor of Chiapas.

3rd-11th of January 1994: Skirmishes between the EZLN and Mexican
military kill hundreds of people as the Mexican military deploys
helicopters, fighter jets, tanks, APCs and special forces.

12th of January 1994: Ceasefire is declared between the EZLN and Mexican
military after pro-EZLN protesters fill every major Mexican city.[^5]

## Result

The Zapatista Revolution was extremely successful, and created a large
autonomous zone known as the [Rebel Zapatista Autonomous
Municipalities](Rebel_Zapatista_Autonomous_Municipalities.md "wikilink").
The extreme outpouring of support led to the massive growth of the
[Global Justice Movement](Global_Justice_Movement.md "wikilink") and the
fall of the PRI dictatorship in Mexico, beginning a [liberal
democracy](Liberalism.md "wikilink"). It also helped inspire various other
uprisings across Mexico.
