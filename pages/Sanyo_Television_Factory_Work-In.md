The **Sanyo Television Factory Work-In** was a 10-day
[work-in](Work-In "wikilink") in Wodonga,
[Australia](Australia "wikilink"). [Workers](Working_Class "wikilink")
took over the [factory](factory "wikilink"), forcing
[management](Bosses "wikilink") to listen to their demands which stopped
many workers from being [fired](Unemployment "wikilink") and increased
[wages](Wage_Labour "wikilink").[^1]
