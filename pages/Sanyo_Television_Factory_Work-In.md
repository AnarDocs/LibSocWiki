The **Sanyo Television Factory Work-In** was a 10-day
[work-in](Work-In.md "wikilink") in Wodonga,
[Australia](Australia.md "wikilink"). [Workers](Working_Class.md "wikilink")
took over the [factory](factory.md "wikilink"), forcing
[management](Bosses.md "wikilink") to listen to their demands which stopped
many workers from being [fired](Unemployment.md "wikilink") and increased
[wages](Wage_Labour.md "wikilink").[^1]
