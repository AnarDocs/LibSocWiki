*Not to be confused with the [February
Uprising](February_Uprising_(Austria) "wikilink") in 1934 in Austria.*

The **February Revolution** (which actually occurred in March) was one
of the [two revolutions](October_Revolution_(Russia) "wikilink") that
happened in [Russia](Russia "wikilink") in
[1917.](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Northern_Asia "wikilink")
Food riots, factory strikes and mutinies in the army led to the end of
the Russian Empire and Tsarist (sometimes spelt Czarist) monarchy and
the formation of a new progressive republic and the rise of soviets.
1,443 people were killed during the revolution in gunfights with
[police](police "wikilink") across Petrograd.[^1]

## Background

The Russian Empire had ruled much of Eastern Europe and Northern Asia
for almost two centuries and was a significant geopolitical force, but
it had largely been left behind in the [Industrial
Revolution](Industrial_Revolution "wikilink") and European Colonisation
of the Americas, Asia, Africa and Oceania. It was left the poorest
country in Europe, and was a brutal police state, ruthlessly hunting
down and suppressing all dissent. Thus, radical ideas spread among urban
workers in the city, conscripted military men, peasant farms and in the
universities. A series of key failed decisions by the ruling government
left the country bankrupt, in an unwinnable war, with massive food
shortages and an increasingly angry population.

### Vodka Tax

According to [The Dictator's
Handbook](The_Dictator's_Handbook_(Book) "wikilink"):

> Kerensky’s revolutionaries were able to storm the Winter Palace in
> February 1917 because the army did not stop them. And the army did not
> bother to stop them because the czar did not pay them enough. The czar
> could not pay them enough because he foolishly cut the income from one
> of his major sources of revenue, the vodka tax, at the same time that
> he fought World War I. Czar Nicholas confused what might seem like
> good public policy with bad political decision making. He had the
> silly idea that a sober army would prove more effective than an army
> that was falling-over drunk. Nicholas, it seems, thought that a ban on
> vodka would improve the performance of Russia’s troops in World War I.
> He missed the obvious downsides, however. Vodka was vastly popular
> with the general populace and, most assuredly, with the troops. So
> popular and widely consumed was vodka that its sale provided about a
> third of the government’s revenue. With vodka banned, his revenue
> diminished sharply. His expenses, in contrast, kept on rising due to
> the costs of the war. Soon Nicholas was no longer able to buy loyalty.
> As a result, his army refused to stop strikers and protesters.[^2]
