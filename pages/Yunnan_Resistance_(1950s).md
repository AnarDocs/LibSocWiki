[anarchists](Anarchism "wikilink") in [Southern China](China "wikilink")
near the border of [Myanmar](Myanmar "wikilink") and
[Vietnam](Vietnam "wikilink"). Most of the guerillas also fought against
the Japanese and Nationalists during the invasion of China, [during the
1950s](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Eastern_Asia "wikilink"), it
was one of the few acts of resistance to the new [authoritarian
socialist](Authoritarian_Socialism "wikilink") government. It was led by
[Chu Cha-pei](Chu_Cha-pei "wikilink"), who was inspired by [Nestor
Makhno](Nestor_Makhno "wikilink") and the [Black
Army](Black_Army_(Ukraine) "wikilink").
