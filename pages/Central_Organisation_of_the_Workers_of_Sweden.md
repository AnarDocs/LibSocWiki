The **Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden** or **Sveriges
Arbetares Centralorganisation, SAC - Syndikalisterna** or **SAC**for
short is an [anarcho-syndicalist](Anarcho-Syndicalism "wikilink") [trade
union](Trade_Union "wikilink") [federation](Confederation "wikilink") in
[Sweden](Sweden "wikilink"). It has over 3,000 members active in 20
local organizations across the country.

## History

The SAC began following the failure of the [1909 General Strike in
Sweden](Swedish_General_Strike_(1909) "wikilink") as much of the working
class felt dissatisfied with the results and angry at the situation in
the country. A [conference in
1910](Timeline_of_Anarcho-Syndicalism "wikilink") held by the
Woodworkers' union in Lund led to its formation by a combination of
trade union activists and socialist groups. The early SAC was inspired
by the [French CGT](General_Confederation_of_Labour_(France) "wikilink")
and the [IWW.](Industrial_Workers_of_the_World "wikilink") It was a
founding member of the
[IWA](International_Workers_Association "wikilink") in 1922 and reached
a peak membership of 37,000 members in 1925.[^1]

The SAC took part in the [Lossmen-Ekträsk
Conflict](Lossmen-Ekträsk_Conflict "wikilink") from 1924 to 1931. In
1928, a splinter and more militant organisation called the [Syndicalist
Workers’
Federation](Syndicalist_Workers’_Federation_(Sweden) "wikilink"). In
1936, with the outbreak of the [Spanish Civil
War](Spanish_Civil_War "wikilink"), more than 500 SAC members joined the
[CNT](National_Confederation_of_Labour_(Spain) "wikilink") to fight in
Spain. It was the main organization opposed to
[Nazism](Fascism "wikilink") in neutral-Sweden during [World War
II](World_War_II "wikilink"), organizing boycotts of Nazi-made goods and
providing shelter for resistance fighters in the country.

In the 1950s the SAC was offered to managed a [state-funded unemployment
benefits scheme](Welfare_State "wikilink"), which they accepted. Leading
to their exit from the IWA in 1956, nearly destroying the IWA. [Albert
Camus](Albert_Camus "wikilink") visited the SAC to accept the Nobel
Prize for Literature in 1957.[^2] In 1958, the SAC set up a youth wing,
the [Syndicalist Group Movement](Syndicalist_Group_Movement "wikilink"),
which collapsed in 1970 from infighting.

In 1998, the SAC was the first openly [feminist](Feminism "wikilink")
union in Sweden. In 1999, SAC activist [Björn
Söderberg](Björn_Söderberg "wikilink") was shot dead in his home by
three neo-nazis, leading to the creation of the Citizenship Pride Award,
given yearly to social justice and trade union activists in Sweden. In
2006, the SAC organized [Malmö26](Malmö26 "wikilink") to protest the
unjust dismissal of a cook from a sushi restaurant.
