**States** or **Governments**are entities composed of a
[hierarchical](Social_Hierarchy "wikilink")
[bureaucracy](bureaucracy "wikilink") that exist to dominate society by
claiming a monopoly on legal violence over a clearly defined
geographical area. According to [libertarian
socialists](Libertarian_Socialism "wikilink"), states are defined by the
anti-democratic nature, excluding most people from making decisions
about how society, either explicitly undemocratic regimes (ie
dictatorships) or maintain a facade of democracy (through elections)
that fail by inertia and complex legal bureaucracy ([representative
democracy](Representative_Democracy "wikilink")). States represent the
most obvious and violent form of [social
hierarchy](Social_Hierarchy "wikilink") in the world today, and their
dissolution is a necessary part of the project for human freedom.

## History

The ultimate 'origin' of the state is still largely a mystery in
politics, the proposed theories of where states come from are listed
below.

### Primary State Formation

*Primary States* are states that developed in stateless societies that
had no contact with other states.

#### Neolithic Revolution

Many theorists argue that the [Neolithic
Revolution](Neolithic_Revolution "wikilink") led to the rise of states,
as the use of [agriculture](agriculture "wikilink") enabled for much
more production of food per person, this meant that people could
specialise in tasks other than gathering food, and the control of food
production and distribution ensured that a society based on class
emerged, and that the state emerged to enforce class society.

Others are critical of this theory, pointing out that many agricultural
societies did not develop states (some even remained strongly
non-hierarchical) such as [Highland New
Guinea](Highland_New_Guinea "wikilink"), [Aboriginal
Australia](Aboriginal_Australia "wikilink") or the
[Haudenosaunee](Haudenosaunee_Confederacy "wikilink").

#### Urbanisation

Some have argued that as people began to migrate from the countryside
into cities to be closer to others for protection and to access greater
food sources from agriculture. The result of this is a large population
that requires urban planning and military defense, only possible through
the collective agreement to create a state.

This theory has been strongly criticised as it fails to offer exact
dates and archeological evidence for its claim, and there first urban
environments ([Catal Huyuk](Catal_Huyuk "wikilink") and [Cayonu
Tepesi](Cayonu_Tepesi "wikilink")) have no evidence of a state, and the
largest urban environments during the formation of states ([Indus River
Valley](Indus_River_Valley_Civilization "wikilink") and [Minoan
Crete](Minoan_Crete_Civilization "wikilink")) have no evidence of a
state.

### Secondary State Formation

*Secondary States* refer to states developed, aided or influenced by an
already existing state over a stateless population.

### Tertiary State Formation

*Tertiary States* refers to states created by direct intervention and
administration by a fully formed state, in order to restore state power
to previously statist populations in which state authority had been
weakened or destroyed, or to impose its authority on a population that
had previously resisted full integration under a state.

### Post-State Formation

*Post-State Society* refers to societies consisting of people who once
lived in a state and faced injustice, soon leaving the state to form
their own, non-state communities that develop their own unique culture.
Examples include [Zomia](Zomia "wikilink").

## Justifications

Various ideologies across the political spectrum have attempted to
justify the state, and collectively these are known as *statism*.

### Divine Right of Kings

Many early states often claimed legitimacy by appealing to religious
theories, claiming that god had granted them (the ruling class) the
right and duty to rule over populations. This idea is also called a
*theocracy*. Theocracies largely collapsed with the Enlightenment and
rise of secular ideals, although theocratic ideals still guide the
states of [Saudi Arabia](Saudi_Arabia "wikilink"),
[Iran](Iran "wikilink"), [Mauritania](Mauritania "wikilink"),
[Sudan](Sudan "wikilink"), [Afghanistan](Afghanistan "wikilink"),
[Vatican City](Vatican_City "wikilink") and parts of
[Israel](Israel "wikilink") and the
[USA](United_States_of_America "wikilink").

### Defense of Revolution

Some states (notably [authoritarian
socialist](Authoritarian_Socialism "wikilink") ones) have claimed their
legitimacy by stating that a state is a necessity for defending the
gains of a revolution from the forces of outside counter-revolution.
Critics put forth the [hydra hypothesis](Hydra_Hypothesis "wikilink"),
that statism and hierarchy make it easier for counter-revolution to
succeed, and that decentralised insurgencies against oppression can last
far longer.

### Progressive Statism

Progressive Statists argue that humanity has a natural tendency to be
bigoted and unequal, and that the state can step in as a progressive
agent to alleviate poverty and enforce equality, thus making people's
lives better. This is generally the view of
[liberals](Liberalism "wikilink") and [social
democrats](Social_Democracy "wikilink"). Critics counter that the state
frequently aids in the creation of artificial poverty and bigotry,
inventing and violently enforcing arbitrary concepts of
[gender](gender "wikilink"), [race](race "wikilink") and
[class](class "wikilink") as well as destroying the
[commons](commons "wikilink"), attacking [squats](Squatting "wikilink"),
[attacking trade unions](Repression_of_Trade_Unions "wikilink") and
privatising key public services, all organisations that clearly help
people escape starvation.

Anti-Statist progressives (like libertarian socialists) argue that the
state only grants these small concessions to prevent greater unrest
(that might threaten the existence of the state) or to accumulate more
power and wealth (ie funding universal healthcare because healthier
citizens are more economically productive) and then exploits the giving
of these concessions as a propaganda technique.

### Social Contract

Social contract arguments typically posit that individuals have
consented, either explicitly or tacitly, to surrender some of their
freedoms and submit to the authority (of the ruler, or to the decision
of a majority) in exchange for protection of their remaining rights or
maintenance of the social order.

Critics of the social contract argue that you cannot give tactic
consent, and that if you do not co-operative with state demands (ie
break a law, stop paying taxes, avoid conscription) the state will
coerce you. This argues that the state is not a legitimate entity, but a
very successful gang.

### Will to Power

[Will to Power](Will_to_Power "wikilink") arguments believe that states
are more or less gangs, and that's okay. Whoever can take power is
justified in holding it. This view is hard to argue against since it is
nihilistic, and nihilists rarely listen to ethics.

### No Justification

Some have argued that no ethical justification for the state exists,
usually known as [philosophical
anarchists](Philosophical_Anarchism "wikilink"), and the state invents
stories to justify its own existence, in the words of [Peter
Gelderloos](Peter_Gelderloos "wikilink"):

> Religion, history, citizenship, nationality, and identity as we know
> it all train us to be incapable of imagining our lives outside of
> state authority. All of us grow up believing that the State is an
> inevitable and universal evolution for humankind that improved the
> quality of our lives; only later are we given access to the
> information that conflicts with this narrative, once it already
> constitutes our fundamental worldview and sense of self. We grow up
> lacking information about [contemporary or historical stateless
> peoples](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Societies "wikilink"). The vast
> majority never surpass this ignorance. States and their leaders are
> fed to us as the protagonists of history, and when the stateless
> cannot be symbolically suppressed as primitive, savage, obsolescent,
> ignorant, evil, or terrorist, they are relegated to the shadowy
> backdrop of a stage the State clearly commands.[^1]
