**Pyotr Alexeyevich Kropotkin** (1842 - 1921) was a
[biologist](Science.md "wikilink"), [geographer](Geography.md "wikilink") and
a [major theorist](List_of_Libertarian_Socialists.md "wikilink") of
[anarcho-communism](Anarcho-Communism.md "wikilink") and [mutual
aid](Mutual_Aid.md "wikilink"). His writings had major influence in
influence in [economics](economics.md "wikilink"), [agricultural
science](Agriculture.md "wikilink"),
[conservation](Environmental_Protection.md "wikilink"), ethology,
[criminology](Crime.md "wikilink"), [city planning](City.md "wikilink"),
geography, geology and biology. He is credited as a major figure within
the modern [environmental movement](Environmentalism.md "wikilink"),
[commune movement](Intentional_Community.md "wikilink"), the scientific
study of behaviour and anarcho-communism.[^1]

## Life

### Family

Peter's family were a line of nobles and generals that had come from the
Rurik dynasty, a pre-Romanov family. Kropotkin's father owned large
tracts of land and nearly 1,200 male serfs in three provinces. His
mother was the daughter of a [Cossack](Cossack.md "wikilink") general.[^2]

### Childhood

He was born in Moscow in 1842, and was a well educated child. He dropped
his princely title at age 12 and declared himself a supporter of a
russian republic. At age 14 he enrolled with 150 other boys for the
Corps of Pages, a military school for the children of nobles where he
witnessed extensive abuse of the boys by the school staff.

Serving as a page for [Tsar Alexander II](Tsar_Alexander_II.md "wikilink"),
he became increasingly skeptical of the Tsar's liberal reputation and
began to sympathise with liberal revolutionaries. Between 1857 and 1861
he began to read a great deal of French history, especially about the
[French Revolution](French_Revolution.md "wikilink"). He also became
increasingly interested in the [peasantry](Peasants.md "wikilink") of much
of Russia. He graduated first of his class from the Corps of Pages and
entered the Russian Army, becoming aid to the governor of Transbaikalia
in Siberia and then an aid to the governor-general of East Siberia.[^3]

### Scientific Work

Kropotkin was eventually fired due to the liberal political activities
of the governors he served under. He accepted a position into a
geographical survey expedition in 1864, crossing North Manchuria from
Transbaikalia to the Amur, and soon was attached to another expedition
up the Sungari River into the heart of Manchuria. The expeditions
yielded valuable geographical results. The impossibility of obtaining
any real reforms in Siberia now induced Kropotkin to devote himself
almost entirely to scientific exploration, in which he continued to be
highly successful.

In 1867, Kropotkin resigned his commission in the army and returned to
St. Petersburg, where he entered the Saint Petersburg Imperial
University to study mathematics, becoming at the same time secretary to
the geography section of the Russian Geographical Society. His departure
from a family tradition of military service prompted his father to
disinherit him, "leaving him a 'prince' with no visible means of
support".

In 1871, Kropotkin explored the glacial deposits of Finland and Sweden
for the Society. In 1873, he published an important contribution to
science, a map and paper in which he showed that the existing maps
entirely misrepresented the physical features of Asia; the main
structural lines were in fact from southwest to northeast, not from
north to south or from east to west as had been previously supposed.
During this work, he was offered the secretaryship of the Society, but
he had decided that it was his duty not to work at fresh discoveries but
to aid in diffusing existing knowledge among the people at large.[^4]

### Radicalisation

The governor under whom Kropotkin served, General Boleslar Kazimirovich
Kukel (1829–1869), was a liberal and a democrat who maintained personal
connections to various Russian radical political figures exiled to
Siberia. These included the writer M. I. Mikhailov (1826–1865), to whom
Kukel sent Kropotkin in 1863 to warn the exiled intellectual that Moscow
[police](police.md "wikilink") agents were on the scene to examine his
ongoing political activities in confinement. As a result of this
assignment, Kropotkin made the acquaintance of Mikhailov, who provided
the young Tsarist functionary with a copy of a book by the French
anarchist [Pierre-Joseph Proudhon](Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon.md "wikilink") —
Kropotkin's first introduction to anarchist ideas. Kukel was
subsequently dismissed from his administrative position, and Kropotkin
moved from administration to state-sponsored scientific endeavors.

Kropotkin continued his political reading, including works by such
prominent liberal and socialist thinkers as [John Stuart
Mill](John_Stuart_Mill.md "wikilink") and [Alexander
Herzen](Alexander_Herzen.md "wikilink"). These readings, along with his
experiences among peasants in Siberia, and his visits Switzerland where
he interacted with the [International Workingmen's
Association](International_Workingmen's_Association.md "wikilink") and the
[Jura Federation](Jura_Federation.md "wikilink") led him to declare himself
an anarchist in 1872.[^5]

### Activism in Russia and arrest

On returning to Russia, Kropotkin's friend Dmitri Klements introduced
him to the [Circle of Tchaikovsky](Circle_of_Tchaikovsky.md "wikilink"), a
socialist/populist group created in 1872 to agitate for a socialist
revolution in Russia. Kropotkin worked to spread revolutionary
propaganda among peasants and [workers](Working_Class.md "wikilink") and
acted as a bridge between the Circle and the aristocracy. Throughout
this period, Kropotkin maintained his position within the Geographical
Society in order to provide cover for his activities.[^6]

### Arrest, Escape and Exile in Europe

In 1872, Kropotkin was arrested and imprisoned in the Peter and Paul
Fortress for subversive political activity, as a result of his work with
the Circle of Tchaikovsky. Because of his aristocratic background, he
received special privileges in prison, such as permission to continue
his geographical work in his cell. He delivered his report on the
subject of the Ice Age in 1876, where he argued that it had taken place
in not as distant a past as initially thought.

In 1876, just before his trial, Kropotkin was moved to a low-security
prison in St. Petersburg, from which he escaped with the help of his
friends. On the night of the escape, Kropotkin and his friends
celebrated by dining in one of the finest restaurants in St. Petersburg,
then boarding to a boat and fleeing to England, before moving to
Switzerland. He moved to France and back to Switzerland.

In 1881, shortly after the assassination of Tsar Alexander II, he was
expelled from Switzerland. After a short stay at Savoy, he stayed in
London for nearly a year. He met numerous radicals during this time,
including [Marie Le Compte](Marie_Le_Compte.md "wikilink"), [Errico
Malatesta](Errico_Malatesta.md "wikilink"), [Saverio
Merlino](Saverio_Merlino.md "wikilink"), [Louise
Michel](Louise_Michel.md "wikilink"), [Nicholas
Tchaikovsky](Nicholas_Tchaikovsky.md "wikilink"), [Émile
Gautier](Émile_Gautier.md "wikilink") and [Varlam
Cherkezishvili](Varlam_Cherkezishvili.md "wikilink"). He was arrested while
travelling in France in 1882 and tried in Lyon (using laws passed since
the fall of the [Paris Commune](Paris_Commune.md "wikilink")) for being a
member of the IWA. He was released in 1886, and helped found the
[Freedom Press](Freedom_Press.md "wikilink") newspaper in Britain with
[Henry Seymour](Henry_Seymour.md "wikilink") and [Charlotte
Wilson](Charlotte_Wilson.md "wikilink"). He also befriend [William
Morris](William_Morris.md "wikilink") and [George Bernard
Shaw](George_Bernard_Shaw.md "wikilink").

During [World War I](World_War_I.md "wikilink") Kropotkin and [Jean
Grave](Jean_Grave.md "wikilink") drafted the [Manifesto of the
Sixteen](Manifesto_of_the_Sixteen.md "wikilink"), advocating for an Allied
Victory of Germany and the Central Powers, which isolated him from the
anarchist movement.[^7]

### Return to Russia

Kropotkin returned to Russia in 1917 following the [Febuary
Revolution](Russian_Revolution.md "wikilink"), greeted by cheering crowds
of tens of thousands of people. He was offered the ministry of education
in the Provisional Government, which he promptly refused, feeling that
working with them would be a violation of his anarchist principles.
Intially enthusiastic about the October Revolution, he lost this
enthusiam upon witnessing the rise of a
[Bolshevik](Bolsheviks.md "wikilink") dictatorship, which he predicted
would fail to bring about communism and compared it to the Jacobins of
the French Revolution.[^8]

### Death

Kropotkin died of pneumonia on the 8th of February, 1921, in the city of
Dmitrov, and was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. Thousands
of people marched in his funeral procession, including, with [Vladimir
Lenin's](Vladimir_Lenin.md "wikilink") approval, anarchists carrying
banners with anti-Bolshevik slogans. The occasion, the last public
demonstration of anarchists in Soviet Russia, saw engaged speeches by
his close friends [Emma Goldman](Emma_Goldman.md "wikilink"), [Alexander
Berkman](Alexander_Berkman.md "wikilink") and [Aron
Baron](Aron_Baron.md "wikilink"). In 1957 the Dvorets Sovetov station of
the Moscow Metro was renamed Kropotkinskaya in his honor.[^9]

## Ideas

Kropotkin's numerous writings explore subjects in almost every field. As
such, he had many, many, many revolutionary ideas on how to change the
world.

### Mutual Aid

Kropotkin spent much of his life reading about and directly observing
animal communities and human society. Leading him to draw the conclusion
that [competition](competition.md "wikilink") and [greed](greed.md "wikilink")
were not present in all societies, but a product of
[states](State_(Polity).md "wikilink"). Co-operation, ont he other hand,
was present in all species, plant and animal and human alike. Leading
him to conclude that it was one of the very building blocks of life
itself, and that denial of this fact by ideologies could lead to the
decline and collapse of civilization.[^10]

### Artificial Poverty

### Urban Decentralization

Kropotkin argued that local agriculture performed in gardens,
small-scale plots and greenhouses could provide a nutritious diet for
most people, drawing inspiration from the urban gardens of Paris. He
also advocated the progressive deconstruction of large cities and
centralized industry in favour of a decentralized system of small towns
and villages which would employ advanced technology in small workshops
and try to consume resources from the surrounding areas. He did this as
not only would it be the fastest way to get rid of states, poverty and
environmental destruction, but also because he believed smaller
communities were more psychologically healthy than large cities which
tend to overwhelm occupants with [noise
pollution](Noise_Pollution.md "wikilink") and crime.[^11]

### Environmentalism

Kropotkin was one of the first people to notice disturbing trends of
pollutions in the industrial world, including the increasing size of
deserts, deforestation, species extinction, air pollution (which also
hurt the working class) and the fragile nature of Earth's climate.[^12]
He also observed that these systems of destruction existed alongside
great amounts of [poverty](poverty.md "wikilink") and [imperialist
wars](Colonialism.md "wikilink") which killed millions of people.[^13] He
resolved to solve these two social problems by creating an
[eco-anarchist](Eco-Anarchism.md "wikilink") society in which poverty would
be eradicated through a [gift economy](Gift_Economy.md "wikilink") and
urban decentralization.

### Support for Indigenous People

### Prison Abolition

Kropotkin spent years in prisons in Russia and France, and became deeply
critical of the modern prison system that eerily foreshadows the modern
prison abolition and prisoner's rights movement. He called them
'universities of crime' which failed to actually stop crime and possibly
even made it worse. They were an action of the state, disguising a
system of internalizing control and suppressing dissent as a progressive
project for public health.[^14]

## Criticism

Being one of the most influential and popular figures within anarchism
has led to some inevitable criticisms and controversy around Kropotkin.
For example, his homophobia and support for Britain in World War I is
universally condemned by the modern anarchist and socialist
movements.[^15] However, other criticisms and counter-criticism have
emerged against his philosophy.

### Optimism

Kropotkin argued that anarchist communities would not have issues of
laziness or sabotage, which some anarchists like [Nestor
Makhno](Nestor_Makhno.md "wikilink") and [Ricardo Flores
Magón](Ricardo_Flores_Magón.md "wikilink") argued that it could occur and
people were obligated to work for the community, besides children, the
sick, the elderly and the disabled.

Kropotkin's optimism about technology is also heavily debated, some
theorists like [Colin Ward](Colin_Ward.md "wikilink"), [Murray
Bookchin](Murray_Bookchin.md "wikilink") and [Kevin
Carson](Kevin_Carson.md "wikilink") support Kropotkin's optimism about
technology as holding the potential to liberate people from oppression,
others, like [Uri Gordon](Uri_Gordon.md "wikilink") and [Peter
Gelderloos](Peter_Gelderloos.md "wikilink") have been more pessimistic.
Argunig that technology perpetuates existing structures in society, and
can make it more difficult to break down oppressive structures and those
structures adapt to use technology to their own advantage.
