[state](List_of_States.md "wikilink") located in the Indian Ocean off the
East Coast of Africa.

## History

### Ancient History

The first human inhabitants of the Comoro Islands are thought to have
been Austronesian settlers travelling by boat from islands in Southeast
Asia. These people arrived no later than the sixth century AD, the date
of the earliest known archaeological site, found on Nzwani, although
settlement beginning as early as the first century has been postulated.

The islands of the Comoros were populated by a succession of peoples
from the coast of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and the Persian Gulf,
the Malay Archipelago, and Madagascar. Bantu-speaking settlers reached
the islands as a part of the greater Bantu expansion that took place in
Africa throughout the first millennium.

According to pre-Islamic mythology, a jinni (spirit) dropped a jewel,
which formed a great circular inferno. This became the Karthala volcano,
which created the island of Grande Comoro.

Development of the Comoros is divided into phases. The earliest reliably
recorded phase is the Dembeni phase (ninth to tenth centuries), during
which each island maintained a single, central village. From the
eleventh to the fifteenth centuries, trade with the island of
[Madagascar](Madagascar.md "wikilink") and merchants from the Middle East
flourished, smaller villages emerged, and existing towns expanded. Many
Comorians can trace their genealogies to ancestors from
[Yemen](Yemen.md "wikilink"), mainly Hadhramaut, and
[Oman](Oman.md "wikilink").

### Middle Ages

According to legend, in 632, upon hearing of [Islam](Islam.md "wikilink"),
islanders are said to have dispatched an emissary, Mtswa-Mwindza, to
Mecca ([Saudi Arabia](Saudi_Arabia.md "wikilink")) - but by the time he
arrived there, the [Prophet Muhammad](Muhammad.md "wikilink") had died.
Nonetheless, after a stay in Mecca, he returned to Ngazidja and led the
gradual conversion of his islanders to Islam.

Among the earliest accounts of East Africa, the works of Al-Masudi
describe early Islamic trade routes, and how the coast and islands were
frequently visited by Muslims including Persian and Arab merchants and
sailors in search of coral, ambergris, ivory, tortoiseshell, gold and
slaves. They also brought Islam to the people of the Zanj including the
Comoros. As the importance of the Comoros grew along the East African
coast, both small and large mosques were constructed. Despite its
distance from the coast, the Comoros is situated along the Swahili Coast
in East Africa. It was a major hub of trade and an important location in
a network of trading towns that included Kilwa, in present-day
[Tanzania](Tanzania.md "wikilink"), Sofala (an outlet for
[Zimbabwean](Zimbabwe.md "wikilink") gold), in
[Mozambique](Mozambique.md "wikilink"), and Mombasa in
[Kenya](Kenya.md "wikilink").

After the arrival of [the
Portuguese](Timeline_of_Portuguese_Imperialism.md "wikilink") in the early
15th century and subsequent collapse of the East African sultanates, the
powerful Omani Sultan Saif bin Sultan began to defeat the
[Dutch](Timeline_of_Dutch_Imperialism.md "wikilink") and the Portuguese.
His successor Said bin Sultan increased Omani Arab influence in the
region, moving his administration to nearby Zanzibar, which came under
Omani rule. Nevertheless, the Comoros remained independent, and although
the three smaller islands were usually politically unified, the largest
island, Ngazidja, was divided into a number of autonomous kingdoms
(*ntsi*). By the time Europeans showed interest in the Comoros, the
islanders were well placed to take advantage of their needs, initially
supplying ships of the route to India and, later,
[slaves](Slavery.md "wikilink") to the plantation islands in the
Mascarenes.

### Colonisation

Portuguese explorers first visited the archipelago in 1503. The islands
provided provisions to the Portuguese fort at Mozambique throughout the
16th century. In 1793, Malagasy warriors from Madagascar first started
raiding the islands for slaves. [France first established colonial rule
in the Comoros in 1841](Timeline_of_French_Imperialism.md "wikilink"). It
was estimated in 1865 that as much as 40% of the population consisted of
slaves. The islands served as a way station for merchants sailing to
Asia and [India](India.md "wikilink") until the opening of the [Suez
Canal](Suez_Canal.md "wikilink") significantly reduced traffic passing
through the Mozambique Channel. The native commodities exported by the
Comoros were coconuts, cattle and tortoiseshell. French settlers,
French-owned companies, and wealthy Arab merchants established a
plantation-based economy that used about one-third of the land for
export crops. After its annexation, France converted Mayotte into a
sugar plantation colony. The other islands were soon transformed as
well, and the major crops of ylang-ylang, vanilla, coffee, cocoa beans,
and sisal were introduced.

In 1886, Mohéli was placed under French protection by its Sultan
Mardjani Abdou Cheikh. That same year, despite having no authority to do
so, Sultan Said Ali of Bambao, one of the sultanates on Ngazidja, placed
the island under French protection in exchange for French support of his
claim to the entire island, which he retained until his abdication in
1910. In 1908 the islands were unified under a single administration and
placed under the authority of the French colonial governor general of
Madagascar. In 1909, Sultan Said Muhamed of Anjouan abdicated in favour
of French rule. In 1912 the colony and the protectorates were abolished
and the islands became a province of the colony of Madagascar.

Agreement was reached with France in 1973 for the Comoros to be
[decolonised](Decolonisation.md "wikilink") in 1978. The deputies of
Mayotte abstained. Referendums were held on all four of the islands.
Three voted for independence by large margins, while Mayotte voted
against, and remains under French administration. On the 6th of July
1975, however, the Comorian parliament passed a unilateral resolution
declaring independence. Ahmed Abdallah proclaimed the independence of
the Comorian State (and became its first president.)

### Independence

The first 30 years of indepedence were a period of political turmoil (20
coups occurred) On the 3rd of August 1975, less than one month after
independence, president Ahmed Abdallah was removed from office in an
armed coup and replaced with United National Front of the Comoros (FNUK)
member Prince Said Mohamed Jaffar. Months later, in January 1976, Jaffar
was ousted in favour of his Minister of Defense Ali Soilih. Soilih
instituted a number of socialist and isolationist policies that soon
strained relations with France. On the 13th of May, 1978, [Bob
Denard](Bob_Denard.md "wikilink"), a supporter of
[Francafrique](Francafrique.md "wikilink"), overthrew the government with
the support of France, Rhodesia and South Africa. The new President
Abdallah reversed the secular measures taken by Soilih and became
increasingly authoritarian and Islamic. Fearing a possible coup in
[1989](Revolutions_of_1989_-_1992.md "wikilink"), he ordered the
Presidential Guard (led by Bob Denard) to disarm the military, shortly
afterwards, Abdallah was allegedly shot dead in his office by a
disgruntled military officer, though later sources claim an antitank
missile was launched into his bedroom and killed him.

Said Mohamed Djohar, his older brother, became president and served
until 1995 until Bob Denard launched another coup until the French
military forced him to surrender as the country became overwhelmed with
strikes, authoritarianism, protests and secessionist movements. The
islands of Anjouan and Mohéli declared their independence from the
Comoros in 1997, in an attempt to restore French rule. But France
rejected their request, leading to bloody confrontations between federal
troops and rebels.

The Comoros became a [representative democracy in
2010](Timeline_of_Representative_Democracy.md "wikilink").
