## Life

Kasja was born in Stockholm, [Sweden](Sweden "wikilink") in 1980. She
has become an accomplished investigative journalist, writing for the
Guardian and other media outlets. She has also published several books
detailing the effects of human trafficking and sex work. In 2015, she

## Ideas

- Capitalism has attempted to escape the oil crisis of the 1970s by
  austerity and destruction of the welfare state, outsourcing to third
  world countries and aggressive financialisation.
- Sex work is not beneficial for women and encourages dehumanization of
  women and human trafficking.
- Sex worker unions are often backed by police and pimps and serve
  little to no benefit to sex workers.
