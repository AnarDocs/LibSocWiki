The **IWW Couriers' Network** is an
[IWW](Industrial_Workers_of_the_World.md "wikilink") group that works with
food delivery workers, mainly those working for UberEats and Deliveroo
in the [UK](United_Kingdom.md "wikilink") and
[Ireland](Ireland.md "wikilink"). Inspired by the [Black
Friday](Black_Friday_(Germany).md "wikilink") actions by food delivery
workers in [Germany](Germany.md "wikilink") in 2017.[^1] It was created in
January 2018, with hundreds of members across Bristol, Cardiff, Glasgow,
Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dublin, Derry and Cork.[^2]

The first strike was launched on the 4th of October, 2018, when
fast-food workers planned strike action around the same time in Chile,
Colombia, the USA, Belgium, Italy, Germany, the Philippines, Japan and
the UK. In London UberEats couriers and workers at Wetherspoons,
McDonald’s and TGI Fridays struck, with some UberEats couriers and Uber
drivers occupying Uber’s headquarters.[^3]

There were further small strikes in cities on the 28th of Janaury, 2019.
There was another strike on the 25th and 26th of May, 2019 for increased
pay per drop for deliveroo drivers and a maximum distance of 2 miles per
drop.[^4]
