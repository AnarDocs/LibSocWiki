This category contains [disambiguation](Help:Disambiguation.md "wikilink")
pages â€” navigational aids which list other pages that might otherwise
share the same title. If an internal link referred you to one of these
pages, you might want to go back and fix it to point directly to the
intended page.

**Pages may be included in this category by the addition of the template
just before the list of similarly-named pages.**
