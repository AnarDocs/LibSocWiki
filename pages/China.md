## Positives and Negatives

*This discussion is really hard to be had because of the presence of
propaganda in both pro and anti-China discourses. We try to use
objective information that neither side could deny.*

### Positives

- According to the World Bank, more than 850 million Chinese people have
  been lifted out of extreme poverty; China's poverty rate fell from 88
  percent in 1981 to 0.7 percent in 2015, as measured by the percentage
  of people living on the equivalent of US\$1.90 or less per day in 2011
  purchasing price parity terms.[^1]

### Negatives

- China has a pretty bad record on foreign policy.
  - From 1974, China (along with the USA) supported Eritrean ML rebels
    against [Socialist Ethiopia](Socialist_Ethiopia "wikilink").[^2]
  - In 1975, China (with the USA and France) provided material support
    for anti-communist rebels in the [Angolan Civil
    War](Angolan_Civil_War "wikilink") that tried to overthrow the
    [socialist government](Socialist_Angola "wikilink").[^3]
  - China tried to invade Vietnam in 1979, RIGHT after Vietnam had
    suffered brutally at the hands at the USA in the Vietnam War. Border
    skirmishes continued until 1991 where relations were normalised.[^4]
  - China, along with the USA and UK, also supported Pol Pot as they
    waged a war against Vietnam and [socialist
    Cambodia](socialist_Cambodia "wikilink").[^5]
  - China ended support for the Communist Party of the Philippines [in
    their
    insurgency](Communist_Insurgency_in_the_Philippines "wikilink") in
    1976 as part of its normalisation of relations with the
    Philippines.[^6]
  - Since 1992, China has been closely cooperative with
    [Israel](Israel "wikilink") on military matters.[^7][^8]
  - Since 2002, China has been selling weapons to the Taliban in
    Afghanistan.[^9]
  - Since 2003, China has supported the government of Sudan whilst
    carrying out [anti-Arab](Arabophobia "wikilink") ethnic cleansing
    and mass rape.[^10]
  - In 2005, China sent military aid to Nepal to help them fight the
    Maoist rebels.[^11]
  - In the 2010s, Chinese state-owned companies invested in gas
    pipelines in Canada over indigenous lands without the consent of
    indigenous people, leading to protests.[^12]
