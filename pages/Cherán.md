**Cherán** is a small
[town](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Societies.md "wikilink") in
[Mexico](Mexico.md "wikilink") that has practiced self-governance since
[2011](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism.md "wikilink") as a result of the
[Cherán Revolution](Cherán_Revolution.md "wikilink").

## Crime

There hasn’t had a slaying or other serious crime since early 2011.[^1]
Cherán has the lowest rate of homicide in Michoacán, and possibly all of
Mexico.[^2] The town employes a system called the 'community guard' to
protect itself. To quote one article on the town:

> "Once the corrupt police and politicians left, the community collected
> the weapons, vehicles, and uniforms and established their own “ronda
> comunitaria” or community guard. When the uprising first began you
> might see elderly women with sticks defending the community. These
> days the community guard is mostly young men and women with
> professional weapons.

> Seven years later and Cherán has one of the lowest levels of violence
> in all of Mexico. Quite an accomplishment while living in the violent
> state of Michoacán. “\[Cherán’s\] main achievement has been peace. It
> has the lowest homicide rate in all of Michoacán – and maybe all of
> Mexico outside of \[the south-eastern state of\] Yucatán,” Benjamín
> Fernández, a sociologist at the Centre for Research and Higher Studies
> in Social Anthropology (Ciesas), told The Guardian.

> While the community guard is by no means a perfect institution it does
> offer benefits to the locals that were not available under the police
> or cartels. Local business owners are no longer forced to pay several
> hundred dollars a month to criminals. The community guard is
> accountable to the town assembly and chosen by the people."[^3]

## Economy

The town has started several [worker
cooperatives](Worker_Cooperative.md "wikilink"), notably a greenhouse,
sawmill and concrete factory.[^4]

## Environmental Protection

[Reforestation](Reforestation.md "wikilink") efforts [undertaken by the
community](Community_Forestry.md "wikilink") have led to the reforestation
of 20,000 hectares of [land](land.md "wikilink") (over three Manhattans) as
of 2018.[^5]
