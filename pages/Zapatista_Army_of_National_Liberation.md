The **Zapatista Army of National Liberation** (Spanish: *Ejército
Zapatista de Liberación Nacional*, **EZLN**), often referred to as the
**Zapatistas** are a [Neo-Zapatist](Neo-Zapatismo.md "wikilink") rebel
group in [Mexico](Mexico.md "wikilink"), that has been responsible for the
[Zapatista Revolution](Zapatista_Revolution.md "wikilink") and the creation
of the [Rebel Zapatista Autonomous
Municipalities](Rebel_Zapatista_Autonomous_Municipalities.md "wikilink").
They are the main participants in the [Chiapas
Conflict](Chiapas_Conflict.md "wikilink"). Mainly made up of rural
indigenous people, there are supporters in Mexican towns and cities as
well as internationally.

## History

### Background

The EZLN is a product of 500 years of indigenous resistance to
colonialism, capitalism and ecocide. Drawing inspirations from the long
history of indigenous [commons](commons.md "wikilink") and armed uprisings
to the Mexican government (notably led by [Emiliano
Zapata](Emiliano_Zapata.md "wikilink") of the [Mexican
Revolution](Mexican_Revolution.md "wikilink")) as well as
[Marxist](Marxism.md "wikilink") and [libertarian
socialist](Libertarian_Socialism.md "wikilink") theory.

In the aftermath of the [Tlatelolco
Massacre](Tlatelolco_Massacre.md "wikilink"), much of Mexico's left
concluded that peaceful, nonviolent protests were doomed to fail.
Leftist student brothers organised to form the FLN (National Liberation
Front), a [Marxist-Leninist](Marxist-Leninism.md "wikilink") group that
operated in secrecy and developed covert networks and safehouses, After
being destroyed by police raids, they attempted to recruit more from
extremely poor indigenous peasants. Setting up safe houses in towns in
Chiapas and secret training camps in the Jungle and contacting a network
of solidarity organisations like Maoist groups, cooperative organisers,
churchs and community organisations.
