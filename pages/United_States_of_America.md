most populous [liberalism](liberalism "wikilink"),
[colonial](Colonialism "wikilink") and
[capitalist](Capitalism "wikilink") [states](List_of_States "wikilink")
in the world, which also possesses the most power and wealth, acting as

## The Bad

- The United States was built on colonising and destroying indigenous
  nations, and once that process was completed turned outwards and began
  to destroy entire nations, from Hawaii to
  [Vietnam](Vietnam_War "wikilink").
- The United States has engaged in numerous acts of [political
  repression](Political_Repression_in_the_USA "wikilink") against its
  population.

## History

*See Also: [Timeline of US
Imperialism](Timeline_of_US_Imperialism "wikilink")*

The USA was born out of the [American
Revolution](American_Revolution "wikilink"), as wealthy
[landlords](Landlord "wikilink") and [slaveowners](Slavery "wikilink")
forged their own nation-state away from the [British
Empire](British_Empire "wikilink"). Progressive forces for wealth and
land reform were rapidly put down, and neighbouring indigenous nations
were conquered in a slow process of manipulation, war and genocide until
the entire continent was conquered.

Black people and women remained in a condition of servitude whilst
limited democratic rights for white men were established by several
armed insurrections. The American Civil War abolished most of the feudal
and slaveowning elements of the economy (with some notable exceptions)
and the economy became increasingly dominated by capitalism and
corporations.
