**World WarÂ II** (often abbreviated to **WWII** or **WW2**), also known
as the **Second World War** was the largest war in history, fought
between 1939 and 1945 and killing between 50 and 85 million people. The
war was fought between two factions, the 'Allies' and the 'Axis'. The
was notably changed the balance of power among
[states](State_(Polity) "wikilink"), with the geopolitical power of
western europe rapidly falling and the emergence of two new
[superpowers](Superpower_(Geopolitics) "wikilink"), allowing for a new
anti-colonial movement to spread across the world, with the
[anti-fascist](Anti-Fascism "wikilink") movement in Europe securing the
construction of [social democracy](Social_Democracy "wikilink").

## History of the War

### Background

The seeds of World War II were sown by the impact of [World War
I](World_War_I "wikilink") and the [Great
Depression](Great_Depression "wikilink") which led to many countries to
slide into authoritarianism and political extreme. The [Russian Empire
collapsed](February_Revolution_(Russia) "wikilink") and became the USSR,
the [Weimar Republic](Weimar_Republic "wikilink") was seized by
[Hitler](Adolf_Hitler "wikilink") and turned into [Nazi
Germany](Nazi_Germany "wikilink") and
[Mussolini](Benito_Mussolini "wikilink") led the March on Rome and
created a fascist state in Italy. Several other [fascist and leftist
uprisings](Revolutions_of_1927_-_1936 "wikilink") across Europe (notably
in [Austria](February_Uprising_(Austria) "wikilink"), Spain, Portugal
and Hungary) led to the creation of several mutually-hostile and
militaristic governments.

The Great Depression and several other events in
[Japan](Japanese_Empire "wikilink") led to the decline of the power of
the democratic wings of government and concentration of power in the
military. Becoming increasingly cut off from global trade as a result of
higher tariffs and drying up international credit, Japan formed an
alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy as they began to conquer
surrounding territories for more resources. Japan invaded Manchuria in
1931 (notably destroying the [Shinmin
Zone](Shinmin_Autonomous_Zone "wikilink")) in order to secure more
natural resources. Italy invaded Ethiopia and Nazi Germany annexed
Austria and invaded Czechoslovakia.

All states exercised a desire for self-sufficiency, with the Japanese
planning to create a greater sphere of influence and puppet states in
Asia and the Pacific Region, Italy desired to rebuild the [Roman
Empire](Roman_Empire "wikilink") and reconquer much of Southern Europe
and Northern Africa and Germany desired to create an entirely [New World
Order](New_Order_(Nazism) "wikilink").

### 1937

One of the first proposed dates for the beginning of World War II was
the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War as Japan attempted to take
control of China but quickly got bogged down in a lengthy guerrilla war.
The war was extremely brutal, with so of the most horrific crimes in
history being committed by both sides.

### 1938

### 1939

1939 is the most commonly proposed date for the start of the war with
the USSR and Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland and subsequent
declaration of war by the British and French Empires against Germany
(but not the USSR). Although this led to the infamous 'Phony War' where
France and Britain did not launch a major attack against Nazi Germany
with disastrous consequences. The USSR also began to pressure Estonia
into granting it access for Soviet soldiers and aircraft and soon
attempted to invade Finland, leading to the Winter War where liberal
democratic Finland allied with Nazi Germany and was able to fend off the
USSRs invasion.

### 1940

Britain and Germany both invade Norway in attempt to take control of
Scandinavia, Germany wins (also taking Denmark) and Finland drives out
the USSR. Germany manages to quickly invade Belgium, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands and France (although much of the French Empire remains
intact). The UK invades Iceland and the USSR annexes Estonia, Lithuania,
Latvia and Moldova.

### 1941

Italy manages to take Somalia off Britain and launches a disastrous
invasion of Greece. Germany steps in to help Italy in Greece. Germany
forms alliances with Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria and invades
Yugoslavia. French colonies enter a civil war as Iraq and Syria are
taken back by the allies. Conflict begins in North Africa between
Italian Libya and British Egypt. Britain manages to end Italy's
occupation of Ethiopia and Somalia and Germany begins an (initially)
highly successful invasion of the USSR.

Germany begins massive bombing raids against the UK and Ireland and the
UK retaliates.

Near the end of the year, Germany begins an invasion of the USSR and
Japan bombs a US navy base in Hawaii, leading to the entry of the US and
USSR into the war, which is arguably the greatest mistake made by
Germany and Japan.

### 1942

### 1943

### 1944

### 1945

Germany loses control of France and Poland and is squeezed between two
massive military powers, some of the most intense fighting of the war
occurs until Soviet soldiers are in sight of Berlin, leading to many
senior Nazi scientists and officers escaping (often to South America,
[the USA](Operation_Paperclip "wikilink") or USSR) and

## Effects

World War II completely changed the world, the geopolitical balance of
power, economics, political philosophy and technology.

#### Decolonisation

*Main Article: [Decolonisation](Decolonisation "wikilink")*

World War II crippled the British, French and Dutch Empires by
destroying the 'home'/core regions of power and inspiring a [new wave of
anti-colonial revolts and
movements](Timeline_of_Anti-Colonialism "wikilink") (Notably in India,
Indonesia, Vietnam and Africa) Many in the colonies were inspired by the
democratic and anti-fascist ideals of the allies and were angered that
it was not extended to them.

#### Economic Boom

Following World War II, there was a notable and giant economic boom in
Western Europe, North America and Japan. This also coincided with a
massive boost in technology and the availability of consumer goods.
