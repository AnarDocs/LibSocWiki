**Socialist Benin**, officially the **People's** or **Popular Republic
of Benin**, refers to a period of [Benin's](Benin.md "wikilink") history
where the government was run according to
[Marxist-Leninist](Marxist-Leninism.md "wikilink") principles. It was one
of many [socialist nations in Africa](African_Socialism.md "wikilink").

## History

### Background

Benin had been a colony of the French Empire since 1892, and in 1960 was
decolonised. The country became poor and unstable as leaders pitted
ethnic groups against eachother to secure their own power.

### Establishment

Established following a military coup in 1972, the leader of the country
(Mathieu Kérékou), initially claiming to be a centrist, announced his
intentions in 1974, nationalising the industrial and financial sectors,
declaring the country to be Marxist-Leninist and pursuing relations with
the [USSR](USSR.md "wikilink"), [Libya](Socialist_Libya.md "wikilink"),
[Cuba](Cuba.md "wikilink"), [East Germany](East_Germany.md "wikilink") and
[North Korea](North_Korea.md "wikilink").

### Trouble

The government survived an attempted military coup organised by France
in 1977 and suffered economic stagnation, an unhappy population and a
corrupt government.

### Collapse

After the introduction of IMF reforms, [an
uprising](Benin_Uprising_(1989).md "wikilink") broke out across the country
over high cost of living and anger at the government. These were
successful and forced the government to abandon Marxist-Leninism and aim
to become a liberal democracy.

## Positives

- Real per capita GDP (constant 2000 US\$) in Benin grew by
  approximately 0.3% per year from 1975 to 1989. While this rate of
  growth is quite weak by absolute standards, it was slightly above the
  norm for sub-Saharan Africa at the time - real per capita GDP for the
  region as a whole declined by about 1.0% per year over the same
  period.
- The government renamed the country from the French colonial name
  Dahomey to Benin, in reference to the African Benin Empire and [Benin
  Megacommunity](Benin_Megacommunity.md "wikilink").
- Cotton production increased.
- Roads were expanded across the country.

## Negatives

- The government was an authoritarian dictatorship which tortured
  political prisoners and antagonised unions and the church.
- In the late 1980s, the government implemented
  [neoliberal](Neoliberalism.md "wikilink") reforms with the assistance of
  the [IMF](International_Monetary_Fund.md "wikilink").
- The government attempted an extreme form of atheism which banned
  practicing of certain religions (whilst allowing the president to
  practice religion in private)
- Teachers left the country after the government reorganised the
  education system
- The former president later became an evangelical christian... eerily
  similar to [Jim Jones](Jim_Jones.md "wikilink")
