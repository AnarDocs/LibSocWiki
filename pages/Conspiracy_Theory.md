**Conspiracy Theories**refer to explanations of an event or situation
that invokes a conspiracy by sinister and powerful actors, often
political in motivation and usually by the government, organised crime
groups or large corporations. Although the term 'conspiracy theory' is
usually used as an insult, many conspiracies actually make more sense
than the official explanations.
