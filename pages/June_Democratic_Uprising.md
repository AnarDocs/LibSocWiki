The **June Democratic Uprising** or **June Democracy Movement** or
**June Struggle** was a massive series of protests and strikes in [South
Korea](South_Korea.md "wikilink") that aimed to overthrow the military
dictatorship that had ran the country since 1979 (South Korea had been
under some kind of military dictatorship since 1948, with a small window
of democracy in 1960 and 1961). It occurred in
[June](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Eastern_Asia.md "wikilink") of
[1987](Revolutions_of_1986_-_1994.md "wikilink") and led to the creation of
a [liberal democracy](Representative_Democracy.md "wikilink") in South
Korea which has lasted until this day.

## Background

South Korea had been under some kind of authoritarian domination for
nearly a hundred years, first as a [colony of
Japan](Japanese_Empire.md "wikilink"), then US occupation and then a string
of military dictatorships from 1948.

## Events

Due to fraudulent elections in the country, a long history of military
dictatorship, the upcoming 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul and the death of
two student democracy activists (Park Jong-chol and Lee-Han yeol)
Student protests and [strikes broke
out](List_of_General_Strikes.md "wikilink") across the country with
millions of participant. Although the army was initially mobilised, the
president didn't want a repeat of the [Gwangju
Uprising](Gwangju_Uprising_(1980).md "wikilink"), and eventually listened
to the protesters.

## Results

The struggle resulted in the democratisation of South Korea with the
expansion of civil liberties and legal rights. Additionally, the next 3
months saw the formation 1,060 [trade unions](Trade_Union.md "wikilink")
and 3,458 [strikes](Strike.md "wikilink").
