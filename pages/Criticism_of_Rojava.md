[Rojava](Rojava "wikilink") has received a lot of criticism from all
sides of the spectrum, some valid, some invalid. This article will
explore these criticisms. Some of the most common critiques are:

- Growing authoritarianism and development of a state
- Promotion of capitalism
- Collaboration with the United States
- Allegations of ethnic cleansing towards Arab people

## Counter-Arguments

- Rojava cooperated with the US given its situation. At the time
  sandwiched between Turkey and ISIS, two extremely agressive entities
  in the Syrian Civil War, the autonomous zone had to accept support
  from the largest army in the world. However, the United States was
  mainly interested in fighting ISIS, and, when almost all of its army
  stationed there left Syria in 2019, Turkey occupied a large portion of
  its border with Rojava. Nothing was done against this by the US due to
  Turkey being in NATO.
