## Life

Lucy was born in 1853 in Buffalo Creek, Texas, although she listed
Virginia as her birthplace on her children's birth certificates. Her
parents were both born in [Mexico](Mexico "wikilink") (with possible
indigenous american and african heritage), and she may have been born a
slave. She may have been married before she turned 18, but ran away from
the marriage.
