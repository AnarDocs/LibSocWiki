The **Maleconazo**or **August 1994 Uprising**was a failed [spontaneous
uprising](Spontaneous_Uprising "wikilink") in [Cuba](Cuba "wikilink") in
[1994](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_the_Caribbean "wikilink")
against the economic policies of the government due to the [Special
Period](Special_Period_(Cuba) "wikilink").

## Background

Cuba had fallen into an economic crisis because of the recent collapse
of the USSR and the US embargo, leading to citizens in extreme poverty
and having to deal with shortages. Combined with a long culture of
resentment towards the governments authoritarianism and the many Cubans
who had fled to the USA, unrest was inevitable.

## Events

People stole boats, damaged hotels, battled police and communist party
members, crowds cried for liberty.

## Results

The Maleconazo triggered the [Balsero
Crisis](Balsero_Crisis_(1994) "wikilink") as thousands of people tried
to flee Cuba for the USA. Fidel Castro claimed that the riots were
[caused by the USA](Bad_Anti-Americanism "wikilink").
