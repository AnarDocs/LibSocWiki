**William Dudley "Big Bill" Haywood** (1869 - 1928) was a founder and
leader of the [IWW](Industrial_Workers_of_the_World "wikilink") and was
involved in several worker uprisings in the
[USA](United_States_of_America "wikilink").

## Life

### Life in Moscow

In the [USSR](USSR "wikilink"), Haywood became a labor advisor to
[Lenin's](Vladimir_Lenin "wikilink") government, and served in that
position until 1923. Haywood also participated in the founding of the
[Kuzbass Autonomous Industrial
Colony](Kuzbass_Autonomous_Industrial_Colony "wikilink"). Various
visitors to Haywood's small Moscow apartment in later years recalled
that he felt lonely and depressed, and expressed a desire to return to
the United States. In 1926 he took a Russian wife, though the two had to
communicate in sign language, as neither spoke the other's language.[^1]

### Death

On May 18, 1928, Haywood died in a Moscow hospital from a stroke brought
on by alcoholism and diabetes. Half of his ashes were buried in the
Kremlin wall; an urn containing the other half of his ashes was sent to
Chicago and buried near the [Haymarket Martyrs'
Monument](Haymarket_Massacre "wikilink").[^2]
