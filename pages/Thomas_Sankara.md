**Thomas Isidore NoÃ«l Sankara** was a revolutionary, soldier and the
former president of [Burkina Faso](Socialist_Burkina_Faso.md "wikilink")
from 1983 to 1987. Ideologically a
[Marxist-Leninist](Marxist-Leninism.md "wikilink"),
[Pan-Africanist](Pan-Africanism.md "wikilink"),
[Feminist](Feminism.md "wikilink") and
[Anti-Imperialist](Anti-Imperialism.md "wikilink"), he led some of the most
ambitious and amazing reforms for ecological, economic and social
change. However, the actions of the ruling class in Burkina Faso, the
[French](Timeline_of_French_Imperialism.md "wikilink") (and possibly
[US](Timeline_of_US_Imperialism.md "wikilink")) governments and his own
government's centralised nature led to his downfall. He has often
affectionately been called "Africa's [Che
Guevara](Che_Guevara.md "wikilink")" for his vision of a united, strong,
equal and prosperous Africa.
