The **American Revolution** was a revolution that began in 1775 and
ended in 1783, leading to the creation of the [United States of
America](United_States_of_America "wikilink") and being the first major
(and successful) revolt against the [British
Empire](British_Empire "wikilink"). It is generally considered to be one
of the most important events to have ever happened, triggering a
revolutionary wave and legitimising
[Enlightenment](Age_of_Enlightenment "wikilink") and liberal ideas.

## Results

The revolution led to the formation of the USA, and the expulsion of
British forces from their continent. However, despite promising 'life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness" the US still denies most people
the right to vote (only granting it to the bourgeoisie), retains the
institution of slavery, represses the rights of women and LGBT people,
invades and wipes out indigenous nations and ensures the permanent
control of the country by a wealthy elite, this will go on to have
disastrous consequences for the world. The democratic, egalitarian and
even proto-socialist inclinations of many revolutionary soldiers were
crushed by a landowning elite which took control of the revolution,
although these libertarian ideals flared up again three more times in
the US throughout the 1700s.

### Unforeseen Consequences

*Many of the further consequences of the revolution were also due in
part to the French revolution.*

- In 1780, high taxes in Spanish colonies used to pay for the American
  Revolutionaries (as part of a proxy war against the British Empire)
  triggers a [massive
  revolution](Rebellion_of_Túpac_Amaru_II "wikilink") among indigenous
  Peruvians.
- In 1781, other parts of the Spanish Empire (notably Colombia and
  Venezuela) [rebel against](Revolt_of_the_Comuneros_(1781) "wikilink")
  said high taxes, although they are disconnected from the indigenous
  revolt in Peru.
- In 1783, 70,000 loyalists fled to [Canada](Canada "wikilink") and
  other parts of the British Empire (out of a population of 3.1 million,
  or 2.2% of the population).
- In 1786, former soldiers of the revolution become disillusioned and
  attempt a [second revolution](Shay's_Rebellion "wikilink"), aiming for
  direct democracy, land reform and lower taxes.
- In 1788, the British Empire colonised
  [Australia](Australia "wikilink") to compensate for the land lost in
  the American Revolution, and began a [campaign of
  extermination](Aboriginal_Australian_Genocide "wikilink") against the
  indigenous population.
- In 1789, the debts and high taxes incurred by the French Empire to
  fund the American Revolutionaries (as part of a proxy way against the
  British Empire) and popularity of enlightenment ideas amongst numerous
  French soldiers and military commanders leads to the [French
  Revolution](French_Revolution "wikilink").
- In 1794, Poland has [a
  revolution](Kościuszko_Uprising_(1794) "wikilink") against the
  [Russian Empire](Russian_Empire "wikilink") led by military commanders
  who participated in the American Revolution and the rebellion attempts
  to establish a similar republic of Poland. It ultimately fails, but
  veterans later become important allies of Napoleon.
- In 1797, a republican insurrection [was attempted in
  Scotland](Scotland_Rebellion_(1797) "wikilink"), inspired by the
  revolutions in France and America, but was violently repressed.
- In 1945, the [Vietnamese
  Revolution](Vietnamese_Revolution_(1945) "wikilink") drew inspiration
  from the American Revolution, although the US eventually engaged in a
  counter-revolution with the French and later invaded to prevent
  Vietnam from achieving full independence.
