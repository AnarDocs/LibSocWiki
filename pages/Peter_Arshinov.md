**Peter Andreyevich Arshinov** was an
[anarcho-communist](Anarcho-Communism.md "wikilink") revolutionary and
historian.

## Life

### Early Life

Peter was born in the village of Andreivka to a family of workers in
1887. He joined the [Bolsheviks](Bolsheviks.md "wikilink") in 1904. In 1905
he was a fitter in a railway workshop in the town of Kizilarbat, in
Turkestan near the Iranian border. He edited the Bolsheviks' newspaper
aimed at railway workers, and fled to Ekaterinoslav the town to avoid
police attention. It was there he became an
[anarchist](Anarchism.md "wikilink"). He started to work in a shovel
factory.

He began organising armed attacks on the representatives of the local
authorities and the police. He joined an anarchist attack on the town's
police headquarters and shot and killed Vasilenko (who had tipped off
police about workers' involvement in the [1905
revolution](Russian_Revolution_(1905).md "wikilink")), the owner of a local
railway company, in front of a large crowd of workers.[^1]

### Arrest

He was arrested for the murder in 1907, and condemned to be executed by
hanging, but escaped during a religious celebration. He took refuge in
France for two years and returned to Russia in 1909 and was arrested for
distributing anarchist propaganda, but escaped from prison again. He
robbed several wine depots and post offices, before being arrested in
Austria in 1910. He was extradited to Russia and sentenced to 20 years
in Butyrki prison, where he met [Nestor
Makhno](Nestor_Makhno.md "wikilink"), teaching him about
[Bakunin](Mikhail_Bakunin.md "wikilink") and
[Kropotkin](Peter_Kropotkin.md "wikilink").[^2]

### Freedom

During the [February
Revolution](February_Revolution_(Russia).md "wikilink"), they were both
released and Peter started the Federation of Anarchist Groups of Moscow,
and was secretary of the union for propaganda of Moscow, organising two
newspapers and paritcipating in the conference of anarchists in Moscow.
He later left for the [Free Territory of
Ukraine](Free_Territory_of_Ukraine.md "wikilink") to produce newspapers
(notably editing [Nabat's](Nabat.md "wikilink") newspaper) and organising
[assemblies](Democratic_Assembly.md "wikilink"). Upon the fall of the Free
Territory in 1921, he fled to Berlin, Germany and lived in Paris and
Chicago, continuing to edit newspapers and playing a role in developing
[Platformism](Platformism.md "wikilink"). He began to openly denounce
anarchism to secure a passage into the [USSR](USSR.md "wikilink"), leading
to all of his old friends harshly ending their friendships. Once living
in the USSR, he organized an underground anarchist movement (leading
some to believe his denouncing of anarchism to be faked to gain the
trust of the USSR) and was executed in 1938.[^3]
