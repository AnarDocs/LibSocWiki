The **South Korean General Strike of 1996-1997** was a [general
strike](List_of_General_Strikes "wikilink") that occurred in [South
Korea](South_Korea "wikilink") in [1996 and
1997](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Eastern_Asia "wikilink") as
trade unionists fought against a new law that would have legalised the
firing of workers, increased the workweek by 12 hours, legalise scab
labor and ban strike funds.

## Results

The general strike eventually led to the law being blocked, however, 11
months later it became legal to fire workers as part of a wave of
reforms triggered by the [Asian Financial Crisis of
1997](Asian_Financial_Crisis_(1997) "wikilink").
