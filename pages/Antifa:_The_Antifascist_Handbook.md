**Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook** is a 2017
[book](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Media.md "wikilink") by [Mark
Bray](Mark_Bray.md "wikilink") that discusses the history and philosophy
behind the [anti-fascist](Anti-Fascism.md "wikilink") movement.

## Summary

### Chapter One: <em>¡No Pasarán!</em>: Anti-Fascism Through 1945

Fascism developed largely out of a mutation of nationalism (originally a
left-wing concept) that developed in the anti-monarchical [revolutions
of 1848](revolutions_of_1848.md "wikilink") which synthesized patriarchy,
anti-semitism, militarism and disdain for the growing democratic and
socialist movements in Europe. The early anti-fascist movements of
France, USA, Italy

- France: In 1925, a gunfight occurred between the Jeunesses Patriotes
  and local communists, killing four fascists. This follows a tradition
  that goes back as far as the [Dreyfus
  Affair](Dreyfus_Affair.md "wikilink"), as anarchists and socialists broke
  into restaurants holding anti-semitic meetings and disrupted them.
- USA: Black groups and socialists formed armed self-defense groups and
  organized raids against the [KKK](Ku_Klux_Klan.md "wikilink") and white
  lynchers in the late 1800s.
- Italy: The [Arditi Del Popolo](Arditi_Del_Popolo.md "wikilink") formed in
  1921 to combat the recent problem of fascist gangs harassing
  socialists. But this fell apart due to left-wing infighting, and led
  to the establishment of the first fascist government. But several lone
  assassination attempts on [Mussolini](Benito_Mussolini.md "wikilink") and
  key fascists were undertaken by anarchists, all of which failed due to
  many coincidences and luck for the fascists.
- Germany: During [World War II](World_War_II.md "wikilink") and the
  [Holocaust](Holocaust.md "wikilink"), numerous Jews and allies fought off
  deportations and attempted to liberate concentration camps.

### Chapter Two: “Never Again”: The Development of Modern Antifa, 1945–2003

Fascism did not die with [Nazi Germany](Nazi_Germany.md "wikilink"), it
instead began to mutate, forming street gangs, gentlemen clubs and in
some cases popular attitudes. The new anti-fascists began to fight back
against these developments in Britain

- Britain: Given that fascism was still fairly popular after the war,
  the [43 Group](43_Group.md "wikilink") was formed by former Jewish
  Soldiers in the British Army. They infiltrated fascist groups led by
  [Oswald Mosely](Oswald_Mosely.md "wikilink") and attacked their meetings
  throughout the 1940s, and disbanded in 1950 as the threat died off. In
  the 1950s, new white supremacists terrorized Caribbean immigrant
  communities, leading to self-defense squads armed with knives, guns
  and molotovs. Another resurgence in the 1960s (triggered in response
  to the [Civil Rights Movement](Civil_Rights_Movement.md "wikilink") in
  the US and [decolonisation](decolonisation.md "wikilink") in Africa) led
  to the formation of the [62 Group](62_Group.md "wikilink") who violently
  attacked fascists.

### Chapter Four: Five Historical Lessons for Anti-Fascists

This chapter draws on five key lessons that the anti-fascist movement
must learn in order to become more effective. They are:

1.  Fascist revolutions have never succeeded. Fascists gained power
    legally.
2.  To varying degrees, many interwar anti-fascist leaders and theorists
    assumed that fascism was simply a variant of traditional
    counterrevolution politics. They did not take it seriously enough
    until it was too late.
3.  For ideological and organizational reasons, socialist and communist
    leadership was often slower to assess the threat of fascism, and
    slower to advocate militant anti-fascist responses, than their
    parties rank-and-file membership.
4.  Fascism steals from left ideology, strategy, imagery and culture.
5.  It doesn't take many fascists to make fascism.

### Chapter Five: “So Much for the Tolerant Left!”: “No Platform” and Free Speech

This chapter answers the most common objections towards militant
anti-fascism, ranging from the effectiveness of militant tactics to
concerns about erasing the right to [free
speech](Free_Speech.md "wikilink").

1.  Erasure of free speech: Free Speech is only guaranteed from the US
    government, it doesn't protect you from violence from other
    citizens. Even then, the US government repeatedly breaks this
    promise by enforcing copyright laws, repression of left-wing
    activists (notably in the [Red](First_Red_Scare.md "wikilink")
    [Scares](Second_Red_Scare.md "wikilink"),
    [COINTELPRO](COINTELPRO.md "wikilink") and the
    [Occupy](Occupy_(Movement).md "wikilink") movement), censorship during
    wartime, lack of rights for prisoners, criminalization of
    immigrants, the shooting of civilians in wars, supporting numerous
    dictatorships across the world, nondisclosure agreements. If it's
    okay to restrict speech in these areas, why shouldn't it be okay to
    restrict it to stop a resurgent fascist movements? And if it isn't
    okay to repress speech in these areas, why do these areas get no
    attention from self-described 'free speech' advocates? Not only
    that, but only using debate to fight fascists has been an unreliable
    strategy, costing millions of people their lives.
2.  Slippery Slope: The idea that anti-fascists will change the
    definitions of fascism to defeat other political enemies (like
    moderate conservatives) or that the existing of a militant group
    will promote or more violent political climate is not grounded in
    any historical fact. Once a fascist movement is defeated,
    anti-fascists quickly disband, as they tend to know what a fascist
    is better than other political groups.
3.  Government Restrictions: Anti-fascists are usually not in favour in
    state restrictions on speech, since they are often used against the
    left in the future. For example, the British Public Order act was
    used against the fascist National Front, but also against the
    miners’ strike of 1984–1985
4.  Shutting down fascism is fascist: Fascists are also known for being
    nationalists, starting wars, and building prisons, so does that mean
    anarchists can accuse liberals who share those qualities of also
    being fascists? Clearly you can’t define an ideology based only on a
    sole attribute.

### Conclusion: Good Night White Pride (or Whiteness Is Indefensible)
