**Economic Democracy** is a philosophy and [school of
thought](Ideology "wikilink") that is closely related to and overlaps
with [libertarian socailism](Libertarian_Socialism "wikilink"),
particulary [mutualism](mutualism "wikilink"). Economic Democracy argues
that capitalism fails to meet its stated goals, which can only be fixed
through abolishing various economic hierarchies (notably in the
workplace and finance) and creating democratic economic organisations.
This is to be done with the creation of co-operatives (mainly worker,
consumer and financial) financial reform, legal reintroduction of the
commons and universal basic income. It was largely developed among
economists and philosophers in the
[US](United_States_of_America "wikilink") in the late 20th century.
