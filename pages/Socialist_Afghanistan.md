**Socialist Afghanistan**, officially the **Democratic Republic of
Afghanistan** refers to a period of the history of
[Afghanistan](Afghanistan.md "wikilink") (1978 - 1992) in which the country
was run in an [authoritarian
socialist](Authoritarian_Socialism.md "wikilink") manner (specifically
[Marxist-Leninist](Marxist-Leninism.md "wikilink")). The government
struggled massively with a civil war against
[US-backed](Timeline_of_US_Hegemony.md "wikilink")
[far-right](Right-Wing_Politics.md "wikilink")
[Islamist](Islamism.md "wikilink") groups and [Maoists](Maoism.md "wikilink").

## Analysis

### Positives

- The major positive action of socialist Afghanistan was the [expansion
  of women's rights](Feminism.md "wikilink"). Forced marriages were banned,
  women and girls were encouraged to work and get an education and legal
  equality between the [sexes](Sex_(Biology).md "wikilink") was introduced.
  Numerous women also held high positions in the Afghani government.

### Negatives

- The government ultimately failed to withstand an imperialist onslaught
  and internal uprisings led by reactionary and conservative forces, as
  well as some on the left.
- In 1979, the government carried out a disastrous effort at land
  reform, it was extremely unpopular and agricultural productivity
  plummeted.
- The plans for industrial development in the late 1980s were extremely
  unsuccessful, promising 25% economic growth a year, but only reaching
  2%. Although how much of this can be attributed to poor government
  planning policies vs the civil war is up for debate.
- Despite widespread literacy campaigns, the government failed to reduce
  illiteracy by much, in contrast to most other socialist societies.
- The government created a new climate of repression that even alarmed
  the [USSR](USSR.md "wikilink").
- The government suffered a massive amount of infighting and debate
  between moderates and radicals.

### Lessons for the Future

- The authoritarian socialists are wrong, top-down governments and
  militaries are not sufficient to defend a socialist society from
  counter-revolutionaries and imperialist aggression. Even with the help
  of the USSR, the government failed to stop the counter-revolution,
  [with disastrous results for the people of
  Afghanistan](Afghani_Civil_War_(1978_-_Present).md "wikilink").
- Central planning is not necessarily good at managing a wartime
  economy, [especially in contrast to other wartime experiments of
  libertarian socialism which even saw living standards
  improve](Revolutionary_Spain.md "wikilink").
- Land reform done by authoritarian socialists is a disaster.

## Major Social Struggles

- 1979: [Herat Uprising](Herat_Uprising_(1979).md "wikilink")
- 1979: [Bala Hissar Uprising](Bala_Hissar_Uprising_(1979).md "wikilink")
