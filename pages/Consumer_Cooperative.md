**Consumer Cooperatives** is a [cooperative](cooperative.md "wikilink")
that aims to lower the price of consumer goods for customers by the use
of aggregate buying power, consumers are members of the cooperative and
elect managers to make decisions about the future of the company.

## Theory and Practice

Consumer Cooperatives exploit [economies of
scale](Economy_of_Scale.md "wikilink") within markets by buying goods in
bulk, lowering the overall cost and allowing the cooperative to sell
goods to members at lower than market rate.

## Data

- It was found in 2013 that consumer co-operatives give 6.9% of profits
  back to communities, compared to conventional
  [capitalist](Capitalism.md "wikilink") businesses which only give 2.4%,
  meaning that consumer cooperatives are nearly three times better for
  local communities than other businesses.[^1]
