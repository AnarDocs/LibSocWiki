**Workers' Self-Management** (also known as **self-management**, **labor
management**, **autogestión,** **workers' control**, **industrial
democracy**and**democratic management**) refers to the democratic and
horizontal management of a workplace. In some variants, all the
worker-members manage the enterprise directly through
[assemblies](Democratic_Assembly "wikilink"); in other forms, workers
exercise management functions indirectly through the election of
specialist managers. It is a key component of [libertarian
socialist](Libertarian_Socialism "wikilink") philosophy, particularly
[syndicalism](syndicalism "wikilink").

## Data

- Research of self-managed enterprises in the US, Latin America and
  Europe found self-management had staff working 'better and smarter'
  with production organized more efficiently. They were also able to
  organize more efficiently on a larger scale and in more
  capital-intensive industries than hierarchical firms.[^1]
- One meta-study of research on self-managed enterprises found that they
  'equal or exceed the productivity of conventional enterprises when
  employee involvement is combined with ownership' and 'enrich local
  social capital.'[^2]
- One massive meta-study on self-managed enterprises found that they can
  increase worker incomes by 70-80%, that they can grow 2% faster a year
  than other businesses and have 9-19% greater levels of productivity,
  45% lower turnover rates and a 30% less likely to fail in the first
  few years of operation.[^3]
- One 1987 study of self-managed firms in Italy, the UK and France found
  a “positive” relationships with productivity. It also found that they
  do not become less productive as they get larger.[^4]
- One 1995 study from the US indicates that “employees who embrace an
  increased influence and participation in workplace decisions also
  reported greater job satisfaction”.[^5]
- One 1995 study of self-management in the timber industry in
  Washington, USA found that self-management is "more efficient than the
  principal conventional firms by between 6 and 14 percent”.[^6]
- One 2011 study in France found that self-managed businesses “had a
  positive effect on workers’ job satisfaction.”[^7]
- One 2019 meta-study indicates that “the impact \[of self-management\]
  on the happiness workers is generally positive”.[^8]
- Three studies from Canada found that self-managed firms were on
  average half as likely to fail compared to hierarchical firms in the
  market economy in 10 years.[^9]
- One 2014 study from of all businesses in Uruguay between 1997 - 2009
  found that self-managed firms worker have 29% smaller chance of
  closure than other firms.[^10]
- One 2005 study from Germany found that on average 1% of businesses
  failed a year, but only 0.1% of self-managed firms.[^11]
- One 2014 study of self-managed firms in Italy found that they were the
  only kind of workplace that led to increased trust between
  workers.[^12]
- One 2018 study of self-managed firms in South Korea found that workers
  maintained higher motivation than in hierarchical firms.[^13]
- One 2013 study of self-managed healthcare firms in the US found that
  workers were significantly more satisfied with their jobs than in
  workplaces.[^14]
- One 2012 study of three Italian towns of similar demographics, income
  and geography and found that towns with more self-managed enterprises
  had:
  1.  Better mental and physical health, and longer lives, with less
      strokes and heart attacks.
  2.  Children were less likely to skip school and skipped school less.
  3.  Less crime, including less domestic violence and greater feelings
      of safety.
  4.  Higher rates of ‘social participation’ (joining clubs and
      charities; giving blood; voting).
  5.  Perception of a more positive society, more supportive personal
      networks and more trust in the government.[^15]
- During the [Sydney Opera House
  Work-In](Sydney_Opera_House_Work-In "wikilink"), productivity improved
  by 27% during construction work as workers' self-management was
  experimented with, due to 'a reduction in absenteeism, abolition of
  demarcation among work roles, and, in general, more efficient
  organization of production by the workers themselves.'[^16]
- During the [Nymboida Mine Work-In](Nymboida_Mine_Work-In "wikilink")
  production was six hundred to seven hundred tons of saleable coal a
  week, compared with about five hundred during hierarchical
  management.[^17]
- During the [Harco Work-In](Harco_Work-In "wikilink"), production
  increased by 27%.[^18]
- From 1968 to 1972, experiments with self-management in General
  Electric's aerospace factories saw increased output and machine
  utilisation, and a reduction on manufacturing losses.[^19]
- From 1992 to 2017, the [Marland Mold
  Factory](Marland_Mold_Factory "wikilink") became self-managed and
  productivity improved by 26%.[^20]
- In 2001, FaSinPat in Argentina saw productivity improvements by
  50%.[^21]

## Famous Examples by Country

*Main Articles: [Historical Examples of Workplace
Takeovers](Historical_Examples_of_Workplace_Takeovers "wikilink") and
[List of Worker Cooperatives](List_of_Worker_Cooperatives "wikilink")*

(Note: this refers to examples of workers taking over a capitalist
workplace and instituting workers' self-management. Not examples of
worker cooperatives which have been set up within capitalism.)

### Algeria

During the Algerian Revolution peasants and workers took control of
factories, farms and offices that were abandoned, with the help of UGTA
militants. Around 1,000 enterprises were placed under workers' control
in 1962, with that number quickly climbing to 23,000+ in the following
years. The FLN passed laws in the newly independent Algeria which
partially institutionalized workers' control, creating a bureaucracy
around workers' councils that centralized them. This caused massive
corruption among new managers as well productivity and enthusiasm in the
project to fall, leading to numerous strikes by workers in protest.
Following a military coup in 1965, workers' control efforts were
sabotaged by the government which began to centralize the economy in the
hands of the state, denying workers control.[^22] Following the [Black
Spring in 2001](Black_Spring_(Algeria) "wikilink"), degrees of workers'
control have been practiced in the area of Kabylie, notably
[Barbacha](Barbacha "wikilink").[^23]

### Argentina

In 1973, with the end of the self-proclaimed [Argentine
Revolution](Argentine_Revolution_(1973) "wikilink"), there was a wave of
strikes and workplace occupations that rocked the country as the first
elections were held, mainly in state-owned industry. 500 occupations of
workplaces were taken out overall, with 350 occurring between the 11th
and 15th of June, mostly of media outlets, health centres and public
transport and government administration. These occupations were
predominantly done in support of Peronism, and failed to achieve any
long lasting results on the eve of the Dirty War. During the
[Argentinazo](Argentinazo "wikilink") in 2001 and in the following
years, around 200 workplaces were taken over by their workers.

### Australia

[Aboriginal Australia](Aboriginal_Australia "wikilink") arguably
practiced degrees of self-management before contact with Europeans for
thousands of years around [farming](Agriculture "wikilink"),
construction of villages, irrigation, dams and fish traps.[^24] In
Northern Queensland from 1908 to 1920, the
[IWW](Industrial_Workers_of_the_World "wikilink") and the Australasian
Meat Industry Employees Union organized a degree of self-management
among meat industry workers.[^25] From 1971 to 1990, Australia saw a
massive wave of workers' control corresponding with strikes all over the
country. Including:

- 1971: [Harco Work-In](Harco_Work-In "wikilink")
- 1972: [Clutha Development Mine
  Work-In](Clutha_Development_Mine_Work-In "wikilink")
- 1972: [Sydney Opera House
  Work-In](Sydney_Opera_House_Work-In "wikilink")
- 1972: [Whyalla Glove Factory
  Work-In](Whyalla_Glove_Factory_Work-In "wikilink")
- 1974: [Wyong Plaza Work-In](Wyong_Plaza_Work-In "wikilink")
- 1975: [Nymboida Mine Work-In](Nymboida_Mine_Work-In "wikilink")
- 1975: [Coal Cliff Work-In](Coal_Cliff_Work-In "wikilink")
- 1978: [Sanyo Television Factory
  Work-In](Sanyo_Television_Factory_Work-In "wikilink")
- 1979: [Union Carbide Work-In](Union_Carbide_Work-In "wikilink")
- 1980: [Department of Social Security
  Work-In](Department_of_Social_Security_Work-In "wikilink")
- 1990: [Melbourne Tramworkers'
  Strike](Melbourne_Tramworkers'_Strike_(1990) "wikilink")

### Bolivia

Self-managed firms are promoted by [FEJUVE](FEJUVE "wikilink") and
[SEMAPA](SEMAPA "wikilink") is partially self-managed.[^26]

### Bosnia and Herzegovina

In 2015, workers took over the [Dita](Dita_(Factory) "wikilink")
detergent factory in Tulsa that was on the verge of bankruptcy, running
it as a co-operative.[^27]

### Brazil

Around bankrupted 70 enterprises have been taken over by about 12,000
workers since 1990 as part of the [recovered factories
movement](Recovered_Factories_Movement "wikilink"), mainly in the
industries of metallurgy, textiles, shoemaking, glasswork, ceramics and
mining. This has been concentrated in the South and Southeast of
[Brazil](Brazil "wikilink").[^28]

### Canada

In 1981, workers led a province-wide [takeover and occupation of BC
Telephones'](BC_Telephone_Work-In "wikilink") phone exchanges for five
days in protest of layoffs, privatisation of a public good and the
increased deskilling of work.[^29]

### Chile

Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, many
[Chilean](Republic_of_Chile "wikilink") workers experimented with
self-management within [agricultural](Agriculture "wikilink"),
[manufacturing](Factory "wikilink") and
[transportation](transportation "wikilink") industries. Following a wave
of strikes for [land reform](Land_Reform "wikilink"), higher
[wages](Wage_Labour "wikilink") and an expanded [welfare
state](Welfare_State "wikilink"). Throughout the presidency of [Salvador
Allende](Salvador_Allende "wikilink"), 35 enterprises experimented with
self-management.[^30][^31]

### China

Self-managed was practiced in the [Guangzhou
Commune](Guangzhou_Commune "wikilink") in the 1920s and the [Shinmin
Autonomous Zone](Shinmin_Autonomous_Zone "wikilink") from [1929 to
1931](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Eastern_Asia "wikilink").

### Czechoslovakia

Workers' control occurred during the [Prague
Spring](Prague_Spring "wikilink"), by January 1969 there were councils
in about 120 enterprises, representing more than 800,000 people, or
about one-sixth of the country’s workers. They were banned in May 1970
and subsequently declined.[^32]

### France

The [Paris Commune](Paris_Commune "wikilink") saw the first applications
of workers' self-management to an industrial economy, with 43
enterprises being given to their workers in 1871.[^33]

### Greece

Since 2016, several bankrupt factories have been re-occupied and
controlled by their former workers who blocked the auctions.

### India

Workers' Control has been common in West Bengal, where feminist workers
took control of a tea plantation in response to abuses from management
in 1974. In Calcutta, 20 factories have been taken over by their workers
throughout the 1980s and 1990s.[^34]

### Indonesia

During the [Indonesian National
Revolution](Indonesian_National_Revolution "wikilink"), railway,
plantation and factory workers across Java implemented workers' control
from 1945 to 1946, until it was crushed by the new Indonesian
Nationalist Government.[^35] In 2007, over a thousand workers in Jakarta
inspired by workers' control in Argentina and Venezuela [took over a
textile factory](PT_Istana "wikilink") in response to wage cuts,
repression of a recently organized union and efforts to fire and
intimidate union organizers.[^36]

### Mexico

Self-management has been practiced among farmers in the [Zapatista
Communities](Rebel_Zapatista_Autonomous_Municipalities "wikilink") since
1994. Since 2011, [Cherán](Cherán "wikilink") has built 3 new
self-managing enterprises, a greenhouse, a sawmill and a concrete
factory.[^37]

### Poland

Workers' control had been practiced in Poland during the Revolution of
1905 as workers protested a lack of political freedoms and poor working
conditions. Workers' control also occurred in around 100 industries in
the aftermath of [World War I](World_War_I "wikilink") with around
500,000 participants. Notably in the short-lived [Republic of
Tarnobrzeg](Republic_of_Tarnobrzeg "wikilink").[^38] As [World War
II](World_War_II "wikilink") was ending, workers took over abandoned and
damaged factories and began running them between 1944 and 1947. In the
aftermath of the 1956 Poznan Protests, workers' control was partially
applied in 3,300 workplaces, but the top-down nature made people lose
faith in them.

### Russia

Between the Revolutions in 1917, several instruments of worker
representation rose up, called Factory committees. Each committee had
varying degrees of workers' representation; with some acting as organs
of worker control and management (or at least supervising the managers),
while others acted as rudimentary forms of trade unions, participating
in collective bargaining agreements. However after the [October
Revolution](October_Revolution_(Russia) "wikilink"), the factory
committees became under the control of the trade unions, while following
a continuing trend of centralization within the soviets.

The USSR experimented with workers' control with the [Kuzbass Autonomous
Industrial Colony](Kuzbass_Autonomous_Industrial_Colony "wikilink")
thanks to the influence from
[IWW](Industrial_Workers_of_the_World "wikilink") from 1922 to 1926
before being destroyed by the government. During May 1988, Under
Gorbachev - along with his reforms of perestroika and glasnost - the
Supreme Soviet implemented the Law on Cooperatives. This legislation
enabled and regulated the creation of worker owned and control of
enterprises, while imposing high taxes and employment restrictions
(which deterred the creation of them).

### Serbia

From 2003 to 2004 in the city of Zrenjanin, workers battled a private
security force after they had taken control of
[Jugoremedija](Jugoremedija "wikilink"), a pharmaceutical factory. They
were given ownership and control of the factory in 2006.[^39]

### Spain

During the [Spanish Revolution](Revolutionary_Spain "wikilink") in 1936
and 1937, 1700 workplaces were taken under workers' control. All
industry in [Marinaleda](Marinaleda "wikilink") has been under workers'
self-management since 1990s. The town has seen full employment and the
lowest house prices in Spain.[^40]

### Sri Lanka

Under self-management, workers were able to efficiently run the [largest
bus service](Sri_Lanka_Transport_Board "wikilink") in the world with
7,000 buses from 1958 to 1978. The ending of self-management in the
industry has led to an increase in accidents, late buses and
overcrowding.[^41]

### Syria

Workers' control has been practiced in several cities and towns during
the [Syrian Civil War](Syrian_Civil_War "wikilink") since 2012 as they
maintain agriculture, run hospitals and maintain basic social services
in the lack of a state.[^42][^43] Workers' control is also practiced in
[Rojava](Rojava "wikilink"), with around a third of all industry being
placed under workers' control as of 2015.[^44]

### Turkey

In 2013, the [Kazova textile factory](Free_Kazova "wikilink") in
Istanbul was occupied by its workers, and in 2014 it was converted into
a worker co-operative.[^45]

### Ukraine

Workers' Control was practiced in Ukraine from 1918 to 1921 within the
[Free Territory of Ukraine](Free_Territory_of_Ukraine "wikilink") in
farms, factories, railways and schools.

### United Kingdom

In the 1970s, 260 workplaces were occupied across the UK, many being run
with self-management.[^46]

### United States

In 1919, the [Seattle Uprising](Seattle_Uprising "wikilink") saw
workers' control in milk deliveries, cafeterias, firefighting and
laundry.[^47]

From 1968 to 1972, General Electric experimented with self-management at
their plant at Lynn River Works in Massachusetts as part of their [Pilot
Program](Pilot_Program_(General_Electric) "wikilink"). The results led
to immediate increases in output and machine utilisation, and a
reduction on manufacturing losses. The program was terminated after it
threatened the traditional authority of management and led to too much
self-reliance, self-respect and self-discipline among workers.[^48]'

In 1976, [Gore Associates](Gore_Associates "wikilink") introduces a high
degree of self-management in their factories, which the company credits
with its ability to make innovations in technology and maintain high
productivity.

Following the [Great Recession](Great_Recession "wikilink"), the
[Republic Windows and Doors
Factory](New_Republic_Windows_and_Doors "wikilink") was occupied and run
as a co-operative in 2008.[^49] The [Evergreen
Cooperatives](Evergreen_Cooperatives "wikilink"), [Cooperative
Jackson](Cooperative_Jackson "wikilink") and [United States Federation
of Worker
Cooperatives](United_States_Federation_of_Worker_Cooperatives "wikilink")
are the three largest groups advocating for workers' self-management.

### Venezuela

Following the [Bolivarian Revolution](Bolivarian_Revolution "wikilink"),
there have been two waves of expropriations linked to workers'
self-management. The first occurred between 2003 and 2005, the second
from 2009 to 2010, both occurred with limited support from the state and
unions. With Hugo Chavez claiming 1,100 workplaces had been put under
self-management. However, heavy state involvement, a lack of autonomous
worker organizing and corruption led to a strong feeling of apathy and
growth of a bureaucracy. But in spite of this development, several
successful cooperatives have developed from this process, drawing
inspiration from figures like [Anton
Pannekoek](Anton_Pannekoek "wikilink") and historical episodes of
workers' control in Argentina and Yugoslavia.[^50]

### Yugoslavia

In Yugoslavia, there was a limited degree of workers' control of
industry which was encoded into law in 1950. This occurred due to the
Tito-Stalin Split and inspiration from the [Paris
Commune](Paris_Commune "wikilink"). However, the poorly designed,
top-down nature of the workers' councils led to corruption, cynicism and
inefficiencies until they were destroyed in the [Yugoslav
Wars](Yugoslav_Wars "wikilink").[^51]
