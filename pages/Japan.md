**Japan** is a [liberal](Liberalism.md "wikilink"),
[colonial](Colonialism.md "wikilink"), [capitalist](Capitalism.md "wikilink")
[state](List_of_States.md "wikilink") in Eastern Asia, it is near
[China](China.md "wikilink"), [South Korea](South_Korea.md "wikilink") and
[Russia](Russia.md "wikilink"). The state claims 6,582 the 11th largest
population of any state and the largest city, Tokyo, holding 38 million
people. It claims the third largest economy, the most highly educated
population, the longest average life expectancy and some of the best
health outcomes for people at all ages.

However, Japan has many, many issues. It has one of the highest suicide
rates in the world, a declining population, a toxic culture, consumes
massive amounts of fossil fuels, has a [sexist](Sexism.md "wikilink")
culture (Japanese women are also heavily fetishised by men in the West).

## Positives and Negatives

### Negatives

- Japan has a strong issue with poverty, with around 16% of the
  population being estimated to live in poverty in 2013, 33% of Japanese
  women who live alone are likely to live in poverty.
- Japan does not have civil rights legislation which prohibits or
  penalizes discriminatory activities committed by citizens, businesses,
  or non-governmental organizations.
- In 2003, a law was passed allowing
  [transgender](transgender.md "wikilink") people to change their legal
  gender on legal documents. Approval requires being over 22 years old,
  unmarried, undergoing sex reassignment surgery, sterilisation, and
  have no minor children. This is pretty
  [transphobic](Transphobia.md "wikilink").

*Main Article: [Meiji Restoration](Meiji_Restoration.md "wikilink")*

### Japanese Empire

The short-lived [Japanese Empire](Japanese_Empire.md "wikilink") began in
1894 as it invaded [Qing China](Qing_China.md "wikilink"), taking Joseon
Korea, Taiwan and several smaller islands in 1895. Japan challenged the
[Russian Empire](Russian_Empire.md "wikilink") in 1904 for control of
nearby ports in China and won, with some massive global consequences. In
[World War I](World_War_I.md "wikilink"), Japan sided with the Allies and
took the [German Empire's](German_Empire.md "wikilink") colonies in Asia
and tfhe Pacific and helped invade Russia during the [Russian Civil
War](Russian_Civil_War.md "wikilink"), stationing troops there until 1924.

The military carried out massive purges of the left (notably anarchists)
and ensured a military-dominated government. In 1931 Japan invaded
Manchuria (northeast China) for resources and quickly won, and in 1937
invaded again, planning to take all of China and beginning one of the
most disastrous wars in human history. In response, the US cut off oil
shipments, leading to the bombing of a US naval base in Hawaii in an
effort to force the US to open oil exports, but simply led to US entry
into World War II and the rapid loss of territory and the nuclear and
firebombing of Japanese cities until they surrendered, the
military-dominated government was disbanded and the US turned Japan into
a liberal client state.

### Boom Years

Following [World War II](World_War_II.md "wikilink"), Japan went through an
economic boom and Japanese culture became popular internationally. Much
of the country moved into cities and the countryside declined.

### Decline

Since the 1990s, Japan has begun to decline. Japan has experienced a
major recession, government scandals, declining population, several
major natural disasters and a huge terrorist attack. An epidemic of
loneliness and unhappiness has swept the youth and the country has a
high suicide rate. This has led to a resurgence of far-right politics
and mental illness.
