closely by the Mongol Empire) run from the
[UK](United_Kingdom "wikilink"). It subjected Africa, the Americas,
Oceania and much of Asia to brutal episodes of colonialism, created the
ideology of white supremacy and concentration camps ([guess where that
lead to](Nazism "wikilink")) and eventually collapsed after two
[world](World_War_I "wikilink") [wars](World_War_II "wikilink") and a
wave of anti-colonial revolts.
