**Colonialism** refers to the process where
[states](State_(Polity) "wikilink") begin to capture large amounts of
territory and subjugate the new population, using military and
psychological means to create a subservient population. Colonialism
played a key role in creating modern racism, global poverty and many
instabilities in the world.
