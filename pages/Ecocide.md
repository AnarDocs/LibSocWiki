**Ecocide** or **Environmental Destruction** is the deliberate or
accidental destruction of natural ecosystems and habitats for human
purposes, it's comparable to genocide and can have [significant effects
on societies](Eco-Collapse_Hypothesis.md "wikilink").

## Ecocide by Country

### Africa

### Asia

#### Russia

Upon the formation of the [Russian Federation](Russia.md "wikilink"),
around 40% of Russia's territory began demonstrating symptoms of
"significant" ecological stress, largely due to a diverse number of
environmental issues, including deforestation, energy irresponsibility,
pollution, and nuclear waste, largely the leftovers of the
[USSRs](USSR.md "wikilink") economic policy. Around 16 million hectares of
forest are lost each year to a variety of causes including logging,
pollution, and fires. 75% of surface water, and 50% of all water in
Russia is now polluted (only 8% of wastewater is fully treated before
being returned to waterways). Over 200 cities in Russia exceed pollution
limits and air pollution is attributed to 17% of childhood and 10% of
adult diseases, as well as 41% of respiratory and 16% of endocrine
diseases.[^1]
