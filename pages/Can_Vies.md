**Can Vies**or **Centre Social Autogestionat Can Vies** is a
[squat](List_of_Squats.md "wikilink") and [social
center](Social_Center.md "wikilink") in
[Barcelona](Squatting_in_Barcelona,_Spain.md "wikilink"),
[Spain](Spain.md "wikilink") that has been squatted since
[1997](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Southern_Europe.md "wikilink").

## History

The building was constructed in 1879 to house resources necessary for
the railroads around Barcelona. During the [Spanish
Revolution](First_Spanish_Revolution.md "wikilink"), it was collectivized
by the [CNT](National_Confederation_of_Labour_(Spain).md "wikilink"). It
soon became the site of several union offices (including the CNT) until
several arson attacks left the building abandoned in the 1990s.

In 1997, young squatters occupied the building and turned it into a
social center. Used for democratic assemblies, newspapers, parties,
movie nights, debates, musicals, theater, book presentations and
communal meals. It was the site of an [squatters
uprising](Battle_for_Can_Vies.md "wikilink") in 2014, as the police
attempted to evict the squat.[^1]
