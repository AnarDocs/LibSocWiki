The **New Deal** was a series of programs, reforms and regulations
enacted by the [US](United_States_of_America.md "wikilink") government from
1933 to 1939 to help stop the [Great
Depression](Great_Depression.md "wikilink"). Many have argued this period
was the closest the US came to socialism, but others have argued
(including the president at the time,
[FDR](Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt.md "wikilink")) that it prevented communist
revolution developing in the US.

## Good

- Creation of the [Civilian Conservation
  Corps](Civilian_Conservation_Corps_(USA).md "wikilink") that helped
  provide employment and restore ecosystems.
- Creation of a system of mortgages to help poorer people rich the
  middle class by building wealth through home ownership.

## Bad

- Prevent a revolution against capitalism.
- Stealing of indigenous land.
- Creation of redlining, ensuring African-Americans could not access
  home ownership easily, preventing wealth being built in black
  communities.
