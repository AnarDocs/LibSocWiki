The **Sydney Opera House Work-In** was an episode of [workers'
control](Workers'_Self-Management "wikilink") that occurred in Sydney,
[Australia](Commonwealth_of_Australia "wikilink") in
[1972](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Oceania "wikilink").

## Background

The Construction of the famous Sydney Opera House took place between
1959 and 1973, or a period of 13 years. In 1972, management had fired a
worker and in response the [workers](Working_Class "wikilink") demanded
the rehiring of said worker and a [wage
increase](Wage_Labour "wikilink") of 25%.
[Management](Bosses "wikilink") refused these requests, and were all
fired. In response, the workers broke into the construction site with a
crowbar and brought their own toolboxes.[^1]

## Events

Workers elected a foreman and safety officer, and when the Department of
Public Works refused to provide engineers, they simply reorganized and
did jobs that did not require engineers. Foreman tried to order the
workers around and threatened to fire them, but were simply told to go
jump into the harbour. Productivity skyrocketed as workers did the same
work which previously took fourty-eight hours in thirty-five (or a 27%
increase), something management had considered impossible. This was a
result in improved morale, efficient organization and less people
skipping work. This frightened management so much that they promised
greater and greater wage increases and better working conditions, but
the workers kept saying no until they got better and better deals.[^2]

## Results

The workers agreed to end their work-in when management agreed to give
them a 25% wage increase, the right to elect their foremen, four weeks
annual leave (later encoded into Australian law for all workers in
1974)[^3] and a large payment for their troubles. The workers were
extremely satisfied with this, and ended their work-in.[^4]
