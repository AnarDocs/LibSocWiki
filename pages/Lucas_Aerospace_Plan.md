The **Lucas Aerospace Plan** was a proposal in 1976 by aerospace
[factory](factory.md "wikilink") workers to redirect their efforts into
producing medical, transport and green energy
[technology](technology.md "wikilink").

## History

### Background

Military Matters Lucas Aerospace was one of Europe's largest designers
and manufacturers of aircraft systems and equipment in the early 1970s.
It had over 18,000 workers on its payroll, spread over 15
[factories](Factory.md "wikilink") throughout Britain. Nearly half of its
income came from building things for the military, such as combat
aircraft and missiles. The British government pushed the company to
restructure by firing 20% of its workers in exchange for access to
military markets with very high profit rates.

The workers soon found out about this, and combined with already low
wages led to a great deal of anger. A strike in 1972 led to an increase
in wages by 167% and several strategies work stoppages gave the workers
a great deal of power. The workers then proposed a new plan after two
years of debate among themselves, based on detailed information on the
machinery and equipment that all Lucas sites had, as well as the type of
skills that were in the company. The aim of the plan was to produce new
things without losing jobs.

## Key Points

Some of the key proposals of the plan include:

- Introduction of [democracy in
  factories](Workers'_Self-Management.md "wikilink") and guaranteed
  employment for workers
- Production of kidney dialysis of machines
- Begin research and production of artificial limb control systems for
  amputees
- Production of sight aids for the blind using the technology in
  aircraft radio systems
- Development of the 'Hobcart' to give mobility to paralysed people
- Produce an improved life support system for ambulances, a prototype
  was developed using a simple heat exchanger and pumping system
- Development of heat pumps in houses to reduce energy consumption
- Production of windmills to generate electricity without fossil fuels
- Development of a 'flexible power pack' which could generate
  electricity renewably on a small scale, for use in poor countries
- Creation of a light-weight vehicle with pneumatic tires that would
  travel on rails and roads if needed. The vehcile would be powered by a
  combination of an internal combustion engine and battery it would use
  50% less fuel and reduce unhealthy pollution from the car. This system
  would be safer, more efficient and cheaper.
- Production of undersea exploration technology
- Production of robotic devices and remote control technology
- Production of improved braking systems for vehicles
