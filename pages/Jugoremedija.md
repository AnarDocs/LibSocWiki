**Jugoremedija** is a pharmaceutical [factory](factory.md "wikilink") in
Zrenjanin, [Serbia](Serbia.md "wikilink") that saw an episode of
[strikes](List_of_Strikes.md "wikilink") from 2003 to 2004 before seeing
[workers' control](Workers'_Self-Management.md "wikilink") from
[2006](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Southern_Asia.md "wikilink").

## Background

The Serbian state sold illegally sold its 68% of shares of ownership to
capitalists and reduced the share of employee ownership from 58% to 32%.
In protest, workers at the factory went on strike and were attacked by
private security forces. Who used dogs to attack strikers and security
forces dislocated several peoples arms. In response, workers would fight
back and lay down in front of security vans and military vehicles.
Eventually, the private security forces evicted all workers and
illegally fired them.[^1]

## Worker Cooperative

Serbian courts eventually ruled that the state's ownership structure
changes were illegal and restored the workers' 58 percent ownership in
the factory. The workers announced plans to begin a program of workers'
control.[^2] The company went bankrupt in 2012 in suspicious
circumstances, as the former owner tried to destroy the factory with
complete support from the state.[^3][^4]
