The **United Voices of the World**(**UVW**) is a [trade
union](Trade_Union "wikilink") based in the
[UK](United_Kingdom "wikilink") that mainly organises among immigrant
workers, particularly from Latin America. It is notable for being highly
successful despite only being around since
[2014](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Northern_Europe "wikilink").

## Timeline

- 2015: Cleaners at a London art gallery stormed an auction and sprayed
  buyers with water pistols in protest of low wages and a lack of sick
  pay.[^1]
- 2016: Office cleaers in London with the UVW went on strike to demand
  rehiring of fired workers (their friends) and a wage increase. The
  strike went on for 52 days (the longest strike in Londons history) and
  the workers' won their demands.[^2]
- 2016: In response to the bullying and firing of female cleaners in
  retail for joining the UVW, hundreds of protesters marched in
  solidarity outside the shop, resulting in her rehiring.[^3]
- 2017: Hotelworkers in the UVW who were kept in the dark about a 12.5%
  service charge increase added to bills (reducing the amount of tips
  gained for workers, leading to workers losing Â£5,000 per year). A
  strike and blockade of the hotel by workers (which led to two being
  arrested) resulted in 100% of service charges going to workers.[^4]
- 2017: [University](University "wikilink") cleaners who joined the UVW
  began weekly strikes with supports from students, resulting in the
  workers getting paid annual leave, sick pay, parental leave pay and
  greater pensions after 10 months of the strike[^5]
- 2018: Recycling workers in the UVW in East London struck in March 2018
  in response to poor working condition and a lack of basic facilities.
  They won contractual sick pay, slower working, new face masks, soap,
  toilet paper, a shower room, and a decent supply of gloves, uniforms
  and hard hats. There was also a wage increase.[^6]
- 2018: The UVW joins the [International Confederation of
  Labor](International_Confederation_of_Labor "wikilink") as an observer
- 2018: Conservative newspaper office cleaners in the UVW were being
  illegally underpaid and threatened with unemployment if they striked.
  But, they went on strike anyway with sympathy protests outside the
  offices, leading to a wage increase beyond the living wage for the
  area.[^7]
- 2019: Government building cleaners in the UVW went on strike in
  response to low wages and wage theft. They won all their demands.[^8]
