**Worker Cooperatives** (also called **Producer
Cooperatives**,**Employee-Owned Enterprises** or **Labor-Managed
Firms**) are [cooperatives](Cooperative.md "wikilink") which produce goods
or provide services and are [managed by their
workers](Workers'_Self-Management.md "wikilink") in
[assemblies](Democratic_Assembly.md "wikilink") or by elected managers.
[Money](Money.md "wikilink") gained by the cooperative is reinvested to pay
for the operating costs of the business (like bills, rent, taxes,
licensing, materials and so on) and then is either equally distributed
to workers via shares or is paid based on the amount of time worked in
the cooperative.

## Data

  Logue and Jacqueline Yates prepared for the world employment report of
  the international labor office

## Explanations for Rarity

Despite generally offering greater rates of productivity and higher
worker happiness, worker cooperatives are exceptionally rare in
capitalist economies, making up less than 1% of total GDP in most
capitalist countries. This apparent paradox has many explanations.

- Worker cooperatives have difficulty raising startup funds
- Worker cooperatives are often connected to the political left, who's
  members usually don't want to start businesses
- Many people aren't aware of worker cooperatives
- Many major businesses have monopoly's and that causes many problems
  for worker cooperatives
