The **Cucuteni-Trypillia Civilization** was an ancient civilization that
practiced [anarcho-communist](Anarcho-Communism.md "wikilink") economics,
[gender equality](Gender_Equality.md "wikilink"),
[sustainability](sustainability.md "wikilink") and a general form of
[libertarian
socialism](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Societies.md "wikilink") between
[5200BCE and 3500BCE](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism.md "wikilink").

## Collapse

There are three major hypothesis' that explain the collapse of the
Cucuteni-Trypillians.

1.  The Sub-Boreal phase (A global climate event which brought the worst
    drought to Europe since the Ice Age) led to a decline in
    agricultural productivity and resorting to a more pastoral and
    hunter-gatherer based economy, leading to the abandonment of
    cities.[^1]
2.  The Cucuteni-Trypillia were progressively assimilated into
    surrounding cultures.
3.  The Cucuteni-Trypillia were killed by neighbouring, warmongering
    tribes.
