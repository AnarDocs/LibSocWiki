The **Guangzhou Commune**was an [anarchist
commune](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Societies "wikilink") which
existed in the city of Guangzhou from [1920 to
1927](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Eastern_Asia "wikilink").

## Background

After the Xinhai Revolution, most of China was under the control of
Warlords. An [anarchist](Anarchism "wikilink") named
[Shifu](Liu_Shifu "wikilink") created a newspaper that inspired numerous
[trade unions](Trade_Unions "wikilink"), [anarchist
militias](Democratic_Militia "wikilink") and
[cooperatives](Co-operative "wikilink") in the city.[^1]

## Anarchism

The entire city was run as an anarchist commune for seven years, during
which time it became a haven for political refugees escaping
[war](war "wikilink") and persecution, many of whom described it as a
utopia or heaven.[^2]

## Collapse

It was destroyed by the [Kuomintang](Kuomintang "wikilink") who attacked
the city and destroyed the anarchist organizations, taking dictatorial
control of the city.[^3]
