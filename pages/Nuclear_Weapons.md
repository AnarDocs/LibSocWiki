**Nuclear Weapons**(sometimes called **atomic weapons**, **nuclear
bombs**, **nukes**, **atomic bombs** or **A-bombs**) are the most
powerful weapons currently in existence, with even small ones being able
to flatten entire cities. They generate extreme amounts of force and
heat via nuclear reactions that create very hot explosions several
kilometres in diameter.

## Accidents with Nuclear Weapons

- 1961: A plane carrying two nuclear bombs in North Carolina, USA lost
  its wing dropped the bombs in the countryside, the parachutes of one
  bomb failed and it broke upon impact, with 5 out of the 6 safety
  devices failing.[^1]
- 1962: During an underground test of a nuclear bomb in the Algerian
  desert by the French military, an improperly sealed shaft has a flame
  burst through its concrete cap and radioactive gases and dust are
  vented into the atmosphere. The explosion climbed up to 2600m high and
  radiation was detected hundreds of kilometers away. About a hundred
  soldiers and officials, including two ministers, were irradiated. The
  number of contaminated Algerians is unknown.[^2]
- 2007: 6 live nuclear weapons in the US are accidentally loaded onto an
  aircraft and left unnoticed and unguarded for 36 hours until being
  discovered by a maintenance crew on the plane in Louisana.[^3]
- 2010: Nuclear missile silos in Wyoming, USA lost contact with a the
  main base, meaning that 50 nuclear missiles had an unknown status for
  an hour and would've been unable to cancel a launch. Luckily, none
  were launched, it was later discovered that [AT&T](AT&T "wikilink")
  had not properly installed communication devices, despite assuring the
  government they had.[^4]

## Nuclear Close Calls

Nuclear 'close calls' are moments in history where the world almost came
close to witnessing a nuclear war.

- 1956: During the [Suez Crisis](Suez_Crisis "wikilink"), the US
  detected unknown aircraft in Turkey, that USSR fighter jets were
  flying over Syria, that a British bomber aircraft had been shot down
  over Syria and that the USSR navy was moving out of the Black Sea into
  the Mediterranean, putting the US on high alert. However, all these
  events had reasonable explanations, the unknown aircraft in Turkey
  were a flock of birds detected in radar, a small air force escort by
  the USSR for the president of Syria, returning from Moscow, that the
  British bomber had crashed due to mechanical failures and the USSR
  navy was simply doing scheduled routine exercises.[^5]
- 1960: US radar equipment in Greenland mistakes a moonrise of Norway
  for a large-scale nuclera missile launch from the USSR. NORAD went on
  high alert. However, doubts about the authenticity of the attack arose
  due to the presence of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in New York as
  head of the USSR's United Nations delegation.[^6]
- 1961: Three US Ballistic Missile Early Warning Sites (one in
  Greenland, one in Alaska and on in England) suddenly lost
  communication with the Strategic Air Command Headquarters, leading
  them to believe a nuclear strike had taken place and bombers started
  their engines, awaiting orders. However, a plane in Greenland
  discovered that no attack had taken place and informed the Strategic
  Air Command that no attack had taken place. It was later discovered
  that a telephone relay station in Colorado had a motor that
  overheated.[^7]
- 1962: On October 26th, during the [Cuban Missile
  Crisis](Cuban_Missile_Crisis "wikilink"). The *B-59* nuclear patrol
  submarine owned by the USSR was harassed by US naval forces forcing it
  to submerge to the ocean floor. Unable to communicate with Moscow and
  running out of power for its life support systems, the dropping of
  practice depth charges (underwater bombs) by US ships were mistaken as
  actual depth charges. The commander of the submarine believed that
  nuclear war had already begun and Moscow had been destroyed and that
  the submarine should destroy the american ship. However, a
  sub-commander persuaded the commander to surface the ship and wait for
  orders via radio. Later that day, after a US spy plane was shot down
  over Cuba, another spy plane accidentally strayed in the airspace of
  the USSR, leading to MiG fighter jets deploying to shoot it down,
  leading to US F-102 fighter jets being deployed, both armed with
  nuclear missiles.[^8] The destruction of a satellite owned by the USSR
  for unknown reasons led the US to believe a nuclear war was
  imminent.[^9]
- 1995: Russian military mistakes a rocket used to research the Aurora
  Borealis in the Arctic Ocean around Norway as a nuclear missile (as it
  is traveling at the same size, speed and route as a nuclear weapon)
  and prepare to launch nuclear weapons against the US and Western
  Europe, but stop after they realise the mistake.[^10]
