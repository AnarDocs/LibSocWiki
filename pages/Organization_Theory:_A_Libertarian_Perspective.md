**Organization Theory: A Libertarian Perspective** is a 2008
[book](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Media.md "wikilink") written by [Kevin
Carson](Kevin_Carson.md "wikilink") which explores the various concepts
associated with organizations (such as data, information, efficiency,
size, distribution, innovation, firm behaviour, costs, hierarchy, law,
regulations and management) from a [libertarian
socialist](Libertarian_Socialism.md "wikilink") perspective. The book also
outlines how a hypothetical [mutualist](Mutualism.md "wikilink") economy
would alter how the distribution data and efficiency would change within
firms.

## Summary

### Part One: State Capitalist Intervention in the Market

#### 1. A Critical Survey of Orthodox Views on Economy of Scale

Market economies seem to be dominated by large, inefficient
organisations called corporations. This is not a result of natural
market forces, but excessive state intervention in the market, despite
this, 'bigger is better' is defended by [Marxian](Marxism.md "wikilink"),
[Austrian](Austrian_School_of_Economics.md "wikilink") and
[Liberal](Liberalism.md "wikilink") economists under the concept of
'economies of scale'.

#### 2. A Literature Survey on Economies of Scale

#### 3. State Policies Promoting Centralization and Large Organizational Size

[Capitalism](Capitalism.md "wikilink") began by massive acts of state
violence and restrictions on liberty in the process of primitive
accumulation. This was done by four main measures in the late 1700s and
early 1800s:

- [Expropriation](Enclosure.md "wikilink") of [common peasant
  land](Commons.md "wikilink") to be used as private holdings for the
  construction of [private property](Private_Property.md "wikilink").
- Restrictions on freedom of working class movement through
  [proto-passport systems](Laws_of_Settlement_(England).md "wikilink") in
  England.
- Restrictions on the bargaining power of the working class through the
  banning of [train unions](Trade_Union.md "wikilink").
- Creation of a global market through tariffs and imperialism.

There have been five major efforts by the state in the last 200 years to
centralise economic power away from small-scale enterprises and worker
cooperatives into large corporations. The first was *the Nineteenth
Century Corporate Legal Revolution*, the creation of nationwide commerce
laws across countries, the establishment of corporations (originally
agents of the state like the [British East India
Company](British_East_India_Company.md "wikilink"))
