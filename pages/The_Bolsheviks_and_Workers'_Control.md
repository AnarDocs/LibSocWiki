The **Bolsheviks and Workers Control** is a 1970 pamphlet by [Chris
Pallis](Chris_Pallis "wikilink") (written with his penname Maurice
Brinton). It offers a timeline of instance that the
[Bolsheviks](Bolsheviks "wikilink") repressed movements for workers
control across [Russia](Russia "wikilink") during the [Russian Civil
War](Russian_Civil_War "wikilink").

## Summary

### 1917

- February: [February
  Revolution](February_Revolution_(Russia) "wikilink"), reappearance of
  Soviets and creation of the [Russian
  Republic](Russian_Republic_(1917) "wikilink").
- March: Workers' councils spring up in every major Russian city and
  industrial centre, their first major achievement is the introduction
  of the 8 hour workday.
- April: Workers' councils gain legal recognition,
- May: Massive smear campaign in the press against the workers'
  councils, soldiers begin siding with the workers' councils after being
  invited to inspect factories. Lenin declares support for them, writing
  "the Party fights for a more democratic workers' and peasants'
  republic, in which the police and standing army will be completely
  abolished and replaced by the universally armed people, by a universal
  militia. All official persons will not only be elected but also
  subject to recall at any time upon the demand of a majority of the
  electors. All official persons, without exception, will be paid at a
  rate not exceeding the average wage of a competent worker." The first
  conference of workers' councils from groups across Russia is held in
  Petrograd. Tensions develop between trade unions and workers'
  councils.
- August: Within conferences of workers' councils, suspicion grows over
  the Bolsheviks' intentions. Pushes are also made for full workers'
  control and creation of socialist newspapers. Capitalists organise
  conferences to counter their influence. Strikes break out across
  mining regions, with one of the main demands being for workers'
  councils to control hiring and firing.
- September: The Menshevik Minister for Labour bans meetings of workers'
  councils during work hours. Authorising bosses to deduct wages from
  the time spent in meetings. By this point, 586 enterprises employing
  over 100,000 workers had been closed down by their bosses over
  shortages and to stop the workers' councils.
- October: Workers' councils conferences begin leading towards an
  [anarcho-syndicalist](Anarcho-Syndicalism "wikilink") position.
- November: [October Revolution](October_Revolution_(Russia) "wikilink")
  (Russia used a different calendar to the current most commonly used
  ones) and Lenin advocates for "introduction of workers' control of the
  production, warehousing, purchase and sale of all products and raw
  materials in all industrial, commercial, banking, agricultural and
  other enterprises employing a total of not less than five workers and
  employees" or enterprises with low profits. However, he contradicts
  himself by pushing for the state to be able to override the will of
  the workers. The idea of workers' control becomes popular in the civil
  service, whilst the Bolsheviks order the dissolution in the Soviet in
  Civil Telephone Workers and the postal service. Bolsheviks begin
  advocating for a mix of top-down central planning and bottom-up
  workers' control. Angering many of the workers' councils.
