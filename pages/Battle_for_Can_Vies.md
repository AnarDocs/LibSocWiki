The **Battle for Can Vies** was an anti-eviction
[uprising](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Revolutions.md "wikilink") near
the [Can Vies](Can_Vies.md "wikilink") [squat](Squatting.md "wikilink"),
Barcelona, [Spain](Spain.md "wikilink") in
[2014](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Southern_Europe.md "wikilink").

## Background

The Can Vies squat had been occupied for over seventeen years and was a
popular community [social center](Social_Center.md "wikilink"). The local
government announced plans to evict the squatters and demolish the
building. This was to remove non-market spaces from the city in order to
[gentrify](Gentrification.md "wikilink") it, increasing
[rents](Rent.md "wikilink") and [prices](Price.md "wikilink") for the [working
class](Working_Class.md "wikilink").

## Events

[Peter Gelderloos](Peter_Gelderloos.md "wikilink") describes the events in
[The Failure of Nonviolence](The_Failure_of_Nonviolence.md "wikilink"):

> On May 26, the police in Barcelona evicted the seventeen-year-old
> squatted social center, Barcelona. The eviction was one small part of
> an ongoing, aggressive gentrification campaign designed to remake
> Barcelona for tourists and tech-sector yuppies, putting an end to
> free, non-commercial spaces and spaces intended for the autonomous use
> of neighbors. That evening, a thousand people gathered in the rain to
> protest, and a small group of a few hundred masked
> [anarchists](Anarchism.md "wikilink") set fire to a media van, smashed
> banks, and attacked [police](police.md "wikilink"). The next day, people
> returned to the streets, setting fire to an excavator that had begun
> to demolish the Can Vies building. Arsons and attacks were carried out
> across the city. The third day, over ten thousand people took to the
> streets, smashing banks, setting up barricades, and fighting with
> police until late in the night. Rioting lasted until the end of the
> week. The Can Vies collective refused to negotiate with the city
> government. The mayor accurately summed up the situation with the
> phrase, “As long as their is violence, there can be no dialogue,”
> underscoring exactly why so many people supported the violence. When
> it became apparent that the police were unable to win in the streets
> and that the revolt might spread to other neighborhoods or even
> throughout the rest of Catalunya (there had been solidarity protests
> in dozens of other towns and cities, with the offices of the ruling
> political party frequently attacked), the mayor abandoned his
> insistence on peacefulness and began pleading for dialogue in any
> form. When the protesters still refused, he unilaterally began to
> throw out concessions, including cancelling the eviction of Can Vies.
> But thanks to the rioters, this was already <em>fait accompli</em>.
> Rioters had retaken the Can Vies building and pushed out police.[^1]

These events are an extremely successful example of [direct
action](Direct_Action.md "wikilink").

## Results

The uprising succeeded in stopping and reversing the eviction of Can
Vies. Squatters had crowdfunded over a hundred euros to rebuild and
renovate the site, which was done with the help of volunteer
firefighters, architects and workers.[^2]
