The **Essenes** were a [Jewish Order](Judaism "wikilink") that applied
[libertarian communist](Anarcho-Communism "wikilink") economics to their
society. They lasted around 200 years, until the Second Temple of
Jerusalem was destroyed.

## Economy

Essenes lived in [common dwellings](Commons "wikilink"), ate meals
together, shared almost all possessions. They earned wages by working
outside the community as farmers or craftsmen.[^1]

## Culture

The Essenes actively rejected free will and believed all events were
predetermined. They also rejected contact with women.[^2]
