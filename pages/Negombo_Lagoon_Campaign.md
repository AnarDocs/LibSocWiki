The **Negombo Lagoon Campaign** was an effort by
[environmentalists](Environmentalism "wikilink") and fishers in
[2010](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Southern_Asia "wikilink") to
stop the construction of a seaplane port for tourists.

## Background

Promises to bring peace and economic prosperity to Sri Lanka were key
parts of the 2005 Mahinda Chinthana development program. The program
included a plan to build a number of seaplane airports to encourage
tourism to more secluded areas of Sri Lanka such as Negombo Lagoon.
Concerns about the destruction of vegetation, natural resources and
water health (that would effect nearby fishers and villagers) were
largely ignored. Fishers estimated that the Negombo Lagoon directly
supports over 5,000 families in 35 villages and indirectly supports
4,000 families, fish sellers, collectors, repair centers, and centers
for the sale of equipment.[^1]

## Events

The first action to protest the construction was when trade unionists,
fishers, catholic priests and environmentalists gathered for a religious
ceremony where they prayed for the end of the project in late 2010.
Three weeks later 8,000 people rowed out hundreds of boats to prevent
digging and announced they would not leave until the project was
canceled. The government threatened to send in the navy to clear the
blockade but eventually opted to stop the project after 10 hours of
protest.[^2]

## Results

The campaign led to an end to the construction of the seaplane project
in Negombo Lagoon.[^3]
