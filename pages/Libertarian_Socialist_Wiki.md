Welcome to Libertarian Socialist wiki! We are an open-source and
cooperative english-language community focusing on the concepts,
practice and history of libertarian socialism. We aim to offer easy to
understand explanations of history, politics and society as well as
documenting resistance to authoritarianism and capitalism from all over
the world.
