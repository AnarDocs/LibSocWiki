Before the introduction of [Islam](Islam "wikilink") to Western Asia,
[societies](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Societies "wikilink") were run
in a highly egalitarian and decentralized manner. Islam acted as a
method of state-formation, but stateless Arabia maybe managed to
influence certain ideas of Islam, notably the ideal of
[shura](shura "wikilink").
