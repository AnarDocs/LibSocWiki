Before the introduction of [Islam](Islam.md "wikilink") to Western Asia,
[societies](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Societies.md "wikilink") were run
in a highly egalitarian and decentralized manner. Islam acted as a

influence certain ideas of Islam, notably the ideal of
[shura](shura.md "wikilink").
