## Life

### Early Life

Patrick was the son of Christopher Patrick Read and Emma McKay, both
originally from Dublin, [Ireland](Ireland.md "wikilink"). In 1898, they
emigrated to [England](United_Kingdom.md "wikilink"), where they settled in
London before moving to Liverpool. Patrick was born on the ship they
took to Liverpool.

In 1912, the family emigrated to [Canada](Canada.md "wikilink"). When the
family returned to England in 1915, Patrick remained in Canada. He
quickly joined the Canadian Army.[^1]

### World War I

Patrick served in the Canadian Expeditionary Force during [World War
I](World_War_I.md "wikilink") in a transmission unit. His unit's role was
to lay telephone lines between the different army units as radio units
were not generally available.

Read joined around 1915 and served for three years, including time on
the Western Front. It is speculated in his obituary, which was published
in the *Industrial Worker* newspaper, that he married while in France
and had a child \[who is thought to have died in [World War
II](World_War_II.md "wikilink")\] During his time in
[France](France.md "wikilink"), he was likely introduced to the ideas of
[Anarcho-Syndicalism](Anarcho-Syndicalism.md "wikilink").[^2]

### Interwar Period

After the war, Patrick returned to Canada and moved to the
[USA](United_States_of_America.md "wikilink"), joining the IWW in 1919. In
1921, he returned to [Ireland](Republic_of_Ireland.md "wikilink") as a
freelance journalist. He became involved in the Communist Party of
Ireland and fought in the Irish Civil War, strongly supporting James
Connolly's ideas for a future Ireland and clashing with Roddy Connolly,
James' son, as Patrick believed Roddy had contributed to the downfall of
Irish Socialism. Eventually leading to his expulsion from the party,
leaving him to move to England in 1924, where he remained until 1932,
and then returning to the USA. In the USA, he became an editor for the
Industrial Worker and founded the Council for Union Democracy,
attempting to combat corruption and violence within many American trade
unions.[^3]

### Spanish Civil War

Patrick was one of the first Americans to sneak over the French border
into [Spain](Spain.md "wikilink") to join the [Spanish Civil
War](Spanish_Civil_War.md "wikilink"), he was offered a leadership position
in the [Abraham Lincoln Brigade](Abraham_Lincoln_Brigade.md "wikilink"),
but refused, citing his anarchist beliefs. He was incredibly critical of
[Stalin's](Joseph_Stalin.md "wikilink") influence on the Republican faction
of the war, and joined the [National Confederation of
Labour](National_Confederation_of_Labour_(Spain).md "wikilink"). He later
fled on the 5th of December, 1938 back to the USA.[^4]

### Later Life

After the Spanish Civil War, he remained an editor for the Industrial
Worker, and died at age 48 on the 16th of November, 1947 after a
cerebral hemorrhage.[^5]
