The **Occupation of Alcatraz** was a 19-month long protest
[occupation](occupation "wikilink")
([1969](Timeline_of_Indigenism "wikilink") -
[1971](Revolutions_of_1967_-_1975 "wikilink")) when 89 indigenous
Americans and their supporters occupied Alcatraz Island in San
Francisco, [USA](United_States_of_America "wikilink"). This group lived
on the island together until the protest was forcibly ended by the U.S.
government.

## Background

Since the [creation](American_Revolution "wikilink") of the
[USA](United_States_of_America "wikilink"), its government had acted in
an extremely oppressive manner towards the indigenous population.
Violating treaties made, subjecting them to brutal racism and stealing
their lands.

In the 1960s, the success of the [civil rights
movement](Civil_Rights_Movement_(USA) "wikilink") kicked off a global
wave of unrest as women, workers, ethnic minorities, environmentalists,
indigenous people and the LGBT community demanded greater rights and
power. In the USA, the indigenous movement became fairly big.

Alcatraz, a former prison island, had been abandoned by the federal
government and in 1964, a small group of indigenous protesters occupied
Alcatraz Island for four hours and offered to buy the island for \$9.40,
the price that it was sold to the US government with the provision that
the US got to continue to use the island's lighthouse for coast guard
activities.

After the loss of the San Francisco Indian Center, which provided
indigenous people with jobs, healthcare, legal aid and social
opportunities there was an increased amount of tension with the
government.

## Events

In the early morning of the 20th of November, 1969, 89 indigenous
Americans, including more than 30 women, students, married couples and 6
children attempted to land on the island. The coast guard intercepted 75
of the protesters, but 14 managed to slip through and landed on the
island. The island's lone guard, who had been warned of the impending
occupation, sent out a message on his radio. "Mayday! Mayday!" he
called. "The Indians have landed!"

Indigenous and non-indigenous people supported the occupation, supplies
were delivered secretly by canoes which avoided coast guard patrols.
Additionally, the [International Longshore and Warehouse
Union](International_Longshore_and_Warehouse_Union "wikilink") supported
the occupation, threatening [to shut down California's major
ports](Political_Strike "wikilink") if the protesters were evicted.
Protesters also set up a radio station called "Radio Free Alcatraz"
which made 39 30-minute broadcasts of which some can be listened to
here. The host, Isani Sioux John Trudell (considered by the FBI to be
very dangerous, despite being completely nonviolent) spoke about issues
facing the indigenous communities in the USA, including the forcible
loss of ancestral lands, matters of spirituality, seriously contaminated
water supply on Native reservations, sharp inequalities in infant
mortality and life expectancy among indigenous americans compared to the
majority white US public. At the height of the occupation more than 400
protesters lived on the island and support groups made consistent
contact with the media and government.

The demands listed by the protesters included:

- Complete control of Alcatraz by indigenous people
- Construction of a cultural centre that included indigenous studies
- Construction of an indigenous spiritual centre
- Construction of an ecology centre
- Construction of an indigenous american museum

The ILWU helped supply the occupation and several celebrities came out
in support. Electrical generators, water barge and an ambulance service
were provided to the island by supporters.

### Collapse

On the 3rd of January, 1970, a 13-year old girl fell to her death on the
island, prompting her family to leave. In addition, drug addiction and
burnout led to many people leaving the island, and soon non-indigenous
people were banned from staying on the island overnight. Electricity and
telephones to the island was cut by the government, destroying Radio
Free Alcatraz and the occupations reputation began to worsen. Internal
divisions among protesters also began to heighten tensions, including
accusations of [co-optation](co-optation "wikilink") by celebrity
supporters. Faced with internal divisions, lack of fresh water and
electricity, decreasing public support, people began leaving the
occupation until just 15 people remained who were removed by a large
[police](police "wikilink") raid on the 11th of June, 1971.

## Results

Along with the [Wounded Knee
Occupation](Wounded_Knee_Occupation "wikilink"), this became one of the
most notable actions of the indigenous movement in the USA and the
protests of the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1975, the Indian
Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 was passed by
Congress, leading to greater equality and empowerment of indigenous
communities in the USA, although it was still not enough. The Alcatraz
Occupation led to an annual celebration of the rights of indigenous
people, Unthanksgiving Day. The occupation also inspired over 200
incidents of indigenous civil disobedience across the USA in the
following years.
