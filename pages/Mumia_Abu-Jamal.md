![](Mumia.jpg "Mumia.jpg") **Mumia Abu-Jamal** (24 April 1954) is a
US-based prisoner, activist and a former journalist who mainly focused
on police corruption in the city of Philadelphia,
[USA](United_States_of_America.md "wikilink").

He is currently in prison due to his alleged involvement in the murder
of police officer Daniel Faulkner during a routine traffic stop in 1981.
His opponents claim he was clearly involved in the murder and subject to
a fair trial, and the allegations of a police attempt to frame him are
just conspiracy theories peddled by his lawyers and idealistic
activists. His supporters claim he is a [political
prisoner](Political_Repression_in_the_USA.md "wikilink") who was framed by
police, and cite numerous inconsistencies in his trial and conflicting
evidence.

## Life

### Early Life and Activism with the Panthers

Mumia was born in 1954 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA with a younger
brother, both attended [public schools](Prussian_Education.md "wikilink").
He got his name from a high school social study teacher, a left-wing
Kenyan immigrant who encouraged students to take on African and Arabic
names. At 14, he was assaulted by white racists and a police officer
during a counter-protest against George Wallace (a then very racist
politician). This led him to join the [Black Panther
Party](Black_Panther_Party.md "wikilink") and found the Philadelphia
chapter with [Reggie Schell](Reggie_Schell.md "wikilink"), where he was
made "Lieutenant of Information"
