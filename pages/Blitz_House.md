The **Blitz House** [social center](Social_Center "wikilink") and
[former squat](List_of_Squats "wikilink") in Oslo,
[Norway](Norway "wikilink") that has been active since
[1982](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Northern_Europe "wikilink").

## History

The Blitz House was created in 1982 with the occupation of an apartment
building in Oslo by a group of young [anarchists](Anarchism "wikilink"),
communists and socialists. But soon the government offered low-rate
renting to the house in exchange for the legal right to occupy the
space. The area became a base for many local anarchist activities,
including the establishment of a vegan cafe, infoshop, queer support
group, [Anti-Fascist Action](Anti-Fascist_Action_(Norway) "wikilink")
and became the site to coordinate numerous protests, including:

- 1986: Protesting British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's visit to
  Oslo
- 1986: Storming Oslo City Hall during a dinner by the city council and
  eating the food set up for the politicians
- 1987: Protesting US Foreign Minister's Caspar Weinberger's visit to
  Oslo
- 2002: Bombing Oslo City Hall as revenge for a statement announcing the
  government's desire to sell the house
- 2003: Throwing eggs and stones at the US embassy in protest of the
  Iraq War
- 2007: Attacking police at Denmark's embassy to protest the decision to
  demolish [Ungdomshuset](Ungdomshuset "wikilink")
- 2011: Protesting a neo-nazi tattoo parlour
