**Marxism** is a complex and influential philosophy based upon the
theories of [Karl Marx](Karl_Marx "wikilink") and [Friedrich
Engels](Friedrich_Engels "wikilink") and is widely seen as one of the
most influential philosophies in human history (and certainly the most
influential anti-capitalist philosophy) Marxist theory is generally
oriented around several major points:

1.  Society is generally divided into different 'classes' based on
    people's relationship to the means of production, whether they work
    on it (the [proletariat](Working_Class "wikilink")) or they own,
    control and reap the benefits of it (the
    [bourgeoisie](Ruling_Class "wikilink")).
2.  These classes are perpetually in conflict. For example, under
    capitalism, the bourgeoisie is happier to earn more profit so they
    cut wages and increase rents, which hurts the proletariat. Whilst
    the proletariat is happier to earn more in
    [wages](Wage_Labour "wikilink") and having reduced
    [rents](Rent "wikilink"), achieved through methods like
    [strikes](Strike "wikilink").
3.  Capitalism is therefore perpetually in conflict with itself, not to
    mention business needs to constantly [grow](Grow_or_Die "wikilink")
    and innovate, leading to a [falling rate of
    profit](Tendency_of_the_rate_of_profit_to_fall "wikilink").
4.  The conflict cannot be resolved without a
    [revolution](revolution "wikilink") which would eliminate class
    distinction by bringing in [common ownership](Commons "wikilink")
    and [production for use](production_for_use "wikilink"), a
    [communist](Communism "wikilink") society.
