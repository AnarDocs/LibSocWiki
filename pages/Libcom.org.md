**libcom.org** is a website that covers politics and history from a
[libertarian communist](Anarcho-Communism.md "wikilink") perspective. It
uploads books, biographies of various communists and
[anti-fascists](Anti-Fascism.md "wikilink"), articles, historical summaries
and perspectives on current news.

## Criticism

Some critics believe that it is a more leftist than libertarian flavor
of Libertarian Socialism, and that for these reasons, it should be
considered a bias source. Another common criticism is its relationship
and problems revolving imperialist, anti-semitic and violent arguments
by Baa'thists and communist Arab nationalists.
