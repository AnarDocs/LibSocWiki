The **Labour Party** is a [political party](Political_Party "wikilink")
that comprises an alliance of [social
democrats](Social_Democracy "wikilink"), moderate socialists and [trade
unionists](Trade_Union "wikilink") across the
[UK](United_Kingdom "wikilink"). As of 2017, Labour had the largest
membership of any party (512,000) in Western Europe.[^1]

## History

### 1900s

The party was formed by trade unions who wished to capture control of
the state in order to improve the position of the UK [working
class](Working_Class "wikilink") in a period of high poverty, poor
working conditions and the [Long Depression](Long_Depression "wikilink")
which brutally hit the working class. First came the Indepedent Labour
Party, ten the Labour Representation Committee (who refused to adopt the
politics of [class struggle](Class_Struggle "wikilink")), and finally
the Labour Party in the 1906 election.

### 1910s

The Labour Party supported Britain's participation in [World War
I](World_War_I "wikilink") just three days after it broke out, despite
being part of the Second International, which was supposed to be
[anti-war](Peace_Movements "wikilink"). Labour Party members joined a
coalition government and collaborate with the introduction of
[conscription](conscription "wikilink"), deskilling of industry and
strikebreaking. In 1918 they adopted a new 'socialist' constitution,
inspired by the [Russian
Revolution](October_Revolution_(Russia) "wikilink"), calling for [common
ownership of industry](Commons "wikilink") and the full value of labor
towards laborers.

### 1920s

The Labour Party gained power for a few months in 1923, but a good sign
of just how much they intended to do, and how clear their attachment to
socialist principles was can be seen from the following. JH Thomas,
Union leader and MP, was appointed to the Colonial Office. He introduced
himself to his departmental heads with the statement: ‘I’m here to see
there is no mucking about with the [British
Empire](British_Empire "wikilink").’ In 1924 the Labour Party destroyed
a strike by dockworkers and railway workers by threatening to invoke a
state of emergency across the country. They also saw the rearmament of
the navy, murder of indigenous Iraqis by bombings and shooting of
strikers in India.

### 1930s

Following the Great Depression, the Labour Party formed a coalition with
other parties that oversaw reduction in wages and the welfare state.
With the outbreak of [World War II](World_War_II "wikilink"), the Labour
Party helped pass the Emergency Power Bill which gave the government to
power to control all person's and property. They helped break wartime
strikes and gave no aid to workers who now had to face increased prices,
harder work and lower living standards.

### 1940s

The Labour Party won the 1945 election by a huge majority and complete
control of the government. The Labour Party
[nationalised](Nationalisation "wikilink") great amounts of industry,
notably coal production, railways, gas, electricity, iron, steels and
the Bank of England (notably unprofitable industries, and Bank of
England stockholders were guaranteed a 12% dividend on investments under
state ownerships). Additionally, they introduced the National Health
Service, a system of free healthcare for British citizens and other
expansions of the welfare state. These measures were done to stop a
revolution after the war, as well as the creation of a healthier and
more compliant working class (howevers, certain treatments had payments
introduced in 1949). Post-war strikes were broken up by the army
directed by the Labour Party.

### 1950s

In 1951, the Labour Party introduced charges on glasses and false teeth
within the NHS. The Labour Party also oversaw the construction of
[nuclear weapons](Nuclear_Weapons "wikilink"), did nothing to stop the
rising of living costs by 30% and that workers should exercise restraint
and not ask for pay rises. Wartime rationing was kept in place, which
ensured that money was spent not on consumption but on investment. The
Labour Party lost the 1951 election, and remained out of government for
13 years.

### 1960s

The Labour Party won the 1964 election, and oversaw falling wages and
increasing living costs through devlauing the pound and austerity
measures such as introducing NHS prescription charges, getting rid of
free milk in secondary schools, taxes on goods and exchange controls
preventing people taking too much money on holidays out of the country
(which the rich evaded). Strikes in protest of these measures were
fought with the 'White Paper' which asked unions to police their
members. In 1968, the racist regime of Kenya attempted to kick out
thousands of Asians (many of whom had British passports). The Labour
Party passed the Commonwealth Immigrants Act which stopped most of them
coming to Britain. They also support the US in the [Vietnam
War](Vietnam_War "wikilink") and the construction of nuclear submarines.

### 1970s

Following the [miners strike of
1974](UK_Miners'_Strike_(1974) "wikilink"), the Labour Party gained
power. They started by introducing massive pay freezes to combat
inflation, which was extremely unpopular and led to wildcat strikes.
They created a scheme which relied on trade unions to stop strikes, but
this failed and inflation, poverty and unemployment soared. They then
took loans from the IMF and cut funding to healthcare and education.
Striking workers were replaced by scab soldiers, increased the presence
of soldiers in Northern Ireland (inciting
[tensions](The_Troubles "wikilink") in the area) and improving their
nuclear submarines. The [Winter of
Discontent](Winter_of_Discontent "wikilink") finally forced the Labour
Party out, where it has remained in opposition ever since.

### 1980s

In 1982, the '[pacifist](Pacifism "wikilink")' Labour Party leader
Michael Foot enthusiastically supported British intervention in the
Falklands War. During [miners strike in 1984 and
1985](UK_Miners'_Strike_(1984-85) "wikilink") the Labour Party and large
trade unions tried to end the strike, condemning mass picketing and
insisting other groups not come out in solidarity.

### 1990s

In 1992, the Labour Party proudly stated that they had prosecuted more
people for non-payment of the Poll Tax.[^2]
