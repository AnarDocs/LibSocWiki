The **Federation of Community Forest Users** is an organization in
[Nepal](Nepal.md "wikilink") that [protects and regenerates
forests](Environmentalism.md "wikilink") and aids impoverish communities in
a [democratic](Democracy.md "wikilink") way. It was founded in
[1988](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Southern_Asia.md "wikilink")
and has 8,500,000 members.[^1]

## Organization

The Federation is a network of independent community groups with powers
to buy or sell property, to negotiate and sell timber, to hold separate
bank accounts and transact independently, to punish offenders, etc. The
groups receive 100 percent of the proceeds of a timber sale, and are
required to spend it on village development and forest regeneration
(although amendments may reduce the percentage).

The organization avoids the expensive tasks of planting and physical
fencing, instead using grassroots tactics like allowing local
communities to develop rules according to their conditions. In some
cases, grazing is totally banned, while in others it is banned for
specific time periods. Some villages employ watchmen, while in others,
members of each household take turns as guards against violators.
Detailed rules are set for how much grass and fuel wood each household
can collect, and when. Violators are fined. The result has been natural
regeneration of trees.[^2]

## History

### Background

The massive amounts of deforestation in Nepal, corruption and
inefficiency in the government forest agency and pressure from
environmentalists pushed the governments of Nepal to decentralize the
management of forests in the late 1980s.[^3]

### Founding

The Federation was founded with government support in 1988.

### Successes

By 2000, the government of Nepal had given control of 17% of the total
forestland in the country to the Federation. A villager from Siranmati
commented:

> “The surrounding hills you see were totally naked some twenty years
> ago. Then the Swiss agency planted these pine trees. But nobody was
> interested in its protection, because it was not ours. Now every
> household is involved in the protection.”[^4]
