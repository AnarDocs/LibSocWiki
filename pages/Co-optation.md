**Co-optation** or **recuperation** is a concept developed by the
[Situationists](Situationism "wikilink") to explain why social movements
often fail to deliver on their promises. It talks about how various
forms of power are able to destroy threats to them by integrating the
movement into power itself.

[Hijacking](Hijacking "wikilink") involves flipping the roles, where
social movements take cultural concepts from the power structures.
