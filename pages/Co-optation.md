**Co-optation** or **recuperation** is a concept developed by the
[Situationists](Situationism.md "wikilink") to explain why social movements
often fail to deliver on their promises. It talks about how various
forms of power are able to destroy threats to them by integrating the
movement into power itself.

[Hijacking](Hijacking.md "wikilink") involves flipping the roles, where
social movements take cultural concepts from the power structures.

## Historical Examples

- 1980s: The [Kraakers](Kraakers.md "wikilink") were co-opted by social
  democrats who offered to give squats to the Kraakers as their own
  homes in order to prevent unrest. (Netherlands)
- 2001: The [Argentinazo](Argentinazo.md "wikilink") was co-opted by
  Peronist political parties into voting for them. (Argentina)
