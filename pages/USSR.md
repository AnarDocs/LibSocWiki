The **Union of Soviet Socialist Republics** (**USSR**), commonly known
as the **Soviet Union,** was a
[Marxist-Leninist](Marxism-Leninism_in_Practice "wikilink")
[state](List_of_States "wikilink") that was created by the
[Bolsheviks](Bolsheviks "wikilink") in 1922 as the [Russian Civil
War](Russian_Civil_War "wikilink") came to an end. It had a long
history, which included defeating [Nazi
Germany](Nazi_Germany "wikilink") and becoming one of the lead players
in the [Cold War](Cold_War "wikilink"), before its takeover by
