The Iraq Uprising of **2011**was an episode of civil unrest in
[2011](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Western_Asia "wikilink")
which were a part of the [Arab Spring](Arab_Spring "wikilink") and a
[larger wave of global revolts](Revolutions_of_2008_-_2014 "wikilink").

## Background

Following the [invasion of Iraq by the USA in
2003](US_Invasion_of_Iraq_(2003) "wikilink") and subsequent occupation,
Iraq had issues of instability, economic turmoil (especially high
unemployment), poor public services, [Saudi
intervention](Saudi_Hegemony "wikilink") in [Bahrain's
uprising](Bahraini_Uprising_(2011) "wikilink") and government
corruption. This led to anger and inspired by the [Tunisian
Revolution](Tunisian_Revolution "wikilink") a man set himself on fire in
protest of unemployment.

## Events

Protests broke out across cities in Iraq, and soon protesters began
occupying government buildings and bridges and soldiers began killing
them. Several government minsiters resigned and corrupt officers were
arrested. Protesters then began liberating people from jails and police
began to kill dozens and arrest hundreds. Protesters also came out
against the US occupation, but the protests fizzled out after 4 months.

## Results

The protests saw some corrupt government officials being arrested and
increase subsidies for utilities. Whether or not the pullout of US
troops in December 2011 was connected to this is unknown.
