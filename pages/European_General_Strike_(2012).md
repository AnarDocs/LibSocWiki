[Spain](Spain "wikilink"), [Italy](Italy "wikilink"),
[Portugal](Portugal "wikilink"), [Malta](Malta "wikilink"),
[Cyprus](Cyprus "wikilink"), [Greece](Greece "wikilink"),

[November](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Western_Europe "wikilink")
[2012](Revolutions_of_2008_-_2014 "wikilink").

## Background

The strike took place in the background of [European
Union](European_Union "wikilink")-led austerity measures, which weakened
the welfare state and workers rights of member countries in the name of
[neoliberalism](neoliberalism "wikilink").

## Events

The strike lasted a single day. In Spain, police and strikers fought in
the streets.

## Results

The strike failed, likely due to the fact that it did not continue until
its demands were met, placing little pressure on the various
[states](State_(Polity) "wikilink") involved.
