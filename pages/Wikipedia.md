**Wikipedia** is an [open-source](Open_Source_Software "wikilink")
project on the internet designed to make knowledge [accessible to
all](Commons "wikilink"). It was founded in
[2001](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism "wikilink") and has since grown
to have versions in nearly 300 languages with 48,000,000 articles
between them all.[^1] According to [Peter
Gelderloos](Peter_Gelderloos "wikilink") (writing in 2010):

> Open Source and participatory technology are steadily becoming
> accessible to an extent unprecedented by proprietary software.
> Wikipedia exemplifies this. Started recently, in 2001, on Open Source
> [Linux](Linux "wikilink") software, Wikipedia is already the largest
> and most accessed encyclopedia in the world, with over 10 million
> articles in more than 250 languages. Rather than being the exclusive
> domain of paid experts from a particular academic subculture,
> Wikipedia is written by everyone. Anyone can author an article or edit
> an existing article, and by allowing this openness and trust it
> provides a forum for instantaneous, multiple-peer review. The
> interests of the broader Wikipedia community of millions provide a
> self-regulating function, so vandalism — false editing and bogus
> articles — are quickly cleaned up, and facts lacking citations are
> challenged. Wikipedia articles avail themselves of a vastly greater
> body of knowledge than the small and generally elitist circle
> represented by academia. In a blind, peer-reviewed study it was judged
> to be as accurate as <em>Encyclopedia Britannica.</em>

> Wikipedia is “self-organizing” and edited by an open body of
> peer-elected administrators. There have been a few publicized cases of
> intentional sabotage, such as when the televised news comedy show
> <em>The Colbert Report</em> rewrote history in one Wikipedia article
> as a gag for their show; but the prank was quickly fixed, as most
> false information on the site tends to be. A more lingering problem is
> posed by corporations who use Wikipedia for public relations purposes,
> tasking paid personnel to maintain a clean image in the articles about
> them. However, contradicting interpretations of the facts can be
> registered in the same article, and Wikipedia contains much more
> information on corporate misdeeds than any traditional
> encyclopedia.[^2]
