The **Moroccan General Strike of 1990** was a [general
strike](List_of_General_Strikes.md "wikilink") in
[Morocco](Morocco.md "wikilink") in
[1990](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Northern_Africa.md "wikilink")
over anger at neoliberalism, high cost of living, authoritarianism and a
desire for democracy.

## Background

In the mid-1980s, Morocco underwent an [economic
crisis](economic_Crisis.md "wikilink") and began implementing
[neoliberal](Neoliberalism.md "wikilink") reforms under the guidance of the
[IMF](International_Monetary_Fund.md "wikilink"), this led to an increase
cost of living, hunger and unemployment mainly suffered by the young.

## Events

The two major trade unions in the country called a general strike that
the government declared undemocratic and illegal. Although before the
announcement the King of Morocco announced wage increases and extension
of benefits. The unions ignored this and went on strike anyway, with
between 40% and 80% of the country going on strike as workers filed up
the streets of cities. Workers attacked upper-class hotels, cars, shops
and banks with molotov cocktails and set up barricades in the street as
[police](police.md "wikilink") attacked them with tear gas, batons and
bullets. Soldiers were deployed and eventually crushed the protests,
killing around 33 people.

## Results

The strike led to the government increased the minimum wage by 15% and
an expansion of sick and maternity leave.
