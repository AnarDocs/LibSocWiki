**Lemmygrad** (under the domain lemmygrad.ml) is an ultra-Dengist and
third-worldist hate forum. Founded in 2020, it is based off Lemmy
open-source software. Although the forum was initially one of the
largest Lemmy instances, it has since become one of the most fringe,
with less than 50 regular users and maintaining even less moderators
than when it was founded.

The presence of this extremist instance has resulted in criticism from
users of other Lemmy instances, particularly in consideration of the
fact that the founder of Lemmy software moderates the instance with an
alternative account. Because of Lemmygrad's hateful rhetoric against
Westerners (and fanatical glorification of Russo-Chinese capitalism and
imperialism), it is largely seen as fringe, with even other communist
users regularly being banned for expressing views in contradiction to
the ultra-revisionist line of the moderator clique.

The site effectively maintains a front-organization, ProleWiki, with the
administrators on that site also being moderators on Lemmygrad.
Obviously suggesting a relationship.
