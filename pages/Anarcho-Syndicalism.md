**Anarcho-Syndicalism** or **Revolutionary Syndicalism** is a
[syndicalist](Syndicalism "wikilink") strategy to create an
[anarchist](Anarchism "wikilink") society by the creation of anarchist
trade unions followed by a wave of [strikes](Strike "wikilink") and
[occupations](Workplace_Occupation "wikilink") to create a society based
on [workers' self-management](Workers'_Self-Management "wikilink").



## History

*See Also: [Timeline of
Anarcho-Syndicalism](Timeline_of_Anarcho-Syndicalism "wikilink")*

### Precursors

Some argue that [Proudhon's](Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon "wikilink") writings
contain the first hints of syndicalism. But [Mikhail
Bakunin](Mikhail_Bakunin "wikilink") lay much of the theoretical
groundwork for anarcho-syndicalism. Arguing that workers forming trade
unions and striking would be a necessity for the working class to
realise its potential in running society in a directly democratic way.

### First Organisations

1910 - Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT)

1912 - Unione Sindacale Italiana (USI)

1922 - International Workers' Association

### Rise to Prominence

Throughout the 1910s and 1920s, anarcho-syndicalism became the dominant
revolutionary ideology among much of the lower classes in Europe, the
USA and South America.

### Rapid Decline

Despite their many victories for the working class, anarcho-syndicalist
organisations were rapidly destroyed with the rise of fascism.

### Irrelevance

After the [Spanish Civil War](Spanish_Civil_War "wikilink") and
destruction of the CNT, anarcho-syndicalism had little to no relevance
anywhere. They organised no strikes and didn't really grow as a
movement. The 1940s and 1950s saw the rise of
[suburbanisation](Suburbia "wikilink") and [social
democracy](Social_Democracy "wikilink"), meaning that the working class
felt secure and the need for radical unionism ended. The remaning
radical left began to support the USSR, as it remained the only
functioning example of a society produced by leftist ideals, in
comparison to the failure of the Spanish Revolution.

### Resurgence

With the fall of the dictatorship of Spain and return of many CNT exiles
to Spain and the reformation of the union. New groups all across the
world formed in inspiration.

### 21st Century

Anarcho-Syndicalism has steadily grown in the 21st century, even if it
remains relatively small in comparison to other ideologies.
