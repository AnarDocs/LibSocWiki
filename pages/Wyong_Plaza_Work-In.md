The **Wyong Plaza Work-In** was an episode of [workers'
control](Workers'_Self-Management "wikilink") in Wyong,
[Australia](Commonwealth_of_Australia "wikilink") in
[1974](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Oceania "wikilink").

## Background

In the town of Wyong, a new shopping center was being built, and one of
the [workers](Working_Class "wikilink") was dismissed by
[management](Bosses "wikilink"), angering the other workers.[^1]

## Events

The workers announced from the jib of the crane that they would remain
there until the job was reopened for all workers. Having expelled the
developer, they organized work along self-management lines; even asking
local residents whether or not they would prefer a
[hospital](hospital "wikilink") to a shopping center.[^2]

## Result

Workers' control at Wyong Plaza lasted six weeks and only ended after
the company agreed to generous allowances and conditions, including the
right of workers to be consulted on “hire and fire” decisions.[^3]
