The **University of Havana Strike** was a [student
strike](Student_Strike.md "wikilink") in Havana, [Cuba](Cuba.md "wikilink"),
[1892](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_the_Caribbean.md "wikilink") in
protest of cuts to university funding.

## Background

The strike began after the announcement of the Robledo Decree, which
[cut government funding](Austerity.md "wikilink") for university. This
caused university workers to be fired, a reduction in wages for the rest
of them and the cutting of PhD programs.[^1]

## Events

Students stopped attending classes for seven weeks and posted notes
expressing their frustration all over the universities walls.[^2]

## Results

The strike resulted in the reversing of the Robledo Decree, increasing
funding for universities.[^3]
