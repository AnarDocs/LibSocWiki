The **Sri Lankan Veterinarian Strike** was a
[strike](List_of_Strikes.md "wikilink") in
[2010](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Southern_Asia.md "wikilink") by
veterinarians ([doctors](Healthcare.md "wikilink") who specialise in
animals) to protect the welfare of the [Sri
Lankas](Sri_Lanka.md "wikilink") elephant population.

## Background

Elephants are a valued part of traditional culture in Sri Lanka, but a
spike in population has led to increased construction on lands
traditionally used by elephants. This means encounters between humans
and elephants are more common and elephants have less space for food,
meaning that elephants are often going onto farms. Stressed elephants
are also quick to anger and will often kill people and destroy property
in fits of rage. The Great Recession also meant the cutting of funding
to wildlife reserves.

## Events

The countries 11 veterinarians went on a week-long [good work
strike](Good_Work_Strike.md "wikilink") in protest of these policies,
refuse to attend work and serving the government (while continuing the
help them). Demanding a meeting with the wildlife department, more
funding for wildlife reserves and compensation for the strike.

## Results

The strike failed to protect the elephants.[^1]
