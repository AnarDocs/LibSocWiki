**Red for Ed** refers to a wave of [strikes](List_of_Strikes.md "wikilink")
by educational workers, notably high school teachers, across the
[US](United_States_of_America.md "wikilink") in [2018 and
2019](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_North_America.md "wikilink").

## Background

Discussions of a strike in West Virginia began in early 2018. In the
first week of February, teachers staged "walk-ins" at schools and some
protested at the West Virginia Capitol.<sup>\[12\]</sup> The strike
proved successful, and inspired those in other states to strike as
well.<sup>\[13\]</sup>

In early April, Oklahoma became the second state to strike, making it
the first time a teacher's strike was held in the state since
1990.<sup>\[14\]</sup> The strike lasted for 10 days, from April 2-12,
after teacher salaries were increased by \$6,000 and support staff
salaries were increased by \$1,250.<sup>\[15\]</sup>

In late April, teachers in Arizona and in Colorado went on strike. The
Colorado strike began on April 27<sup>\[16\]</sup> and ended on May
12,<sup>\[17\]</sup> while the Arizona Strike lasted from April 26 to
May 3.<sup>\[18\]</sup>

In May 2018, it was reported that teachers in North Carolina could be
next to strike, making it the fifth state to have a teachers'
strike.<sup>\[19\]</sup> This was due to the state being ranked 41st in
the nation in salaries for teachers, and per pupil spending at negative
12 percent.<sup>\[20\]</sup> Further, it was reported that teachers in
North Carolina have seen a five percent decrease in salaries since 2008.
Furthermore, teachers hired after January 1, 2021, will not receive
health benefits, along with teachers having to pay \$10,000 per year in
out of pocket health insurance.<sup>\[21\]</sup>

Because of a majority of the strikes being in predominantly Republican
Party-controlled, conservative states,<sup>\[22\]</sup> the strikes have
been referred to as the "Red State Revolt".<sup>\[23\]\[24\]\[25\]</sup>
This has prompted several Republican politicians to concede to their
demands, in the run-up to the 2018 mid-term elections.<sup>\[26\]</sup>

### Pension costs

One of the largest reasons for decreasing teacher pay and less funding
for schools is the large amount of money diverted from current budgets
to pay educators' unfunded pension liabilities. <sup>\[27\]:1</sup> For
example: "In Colorado, school district payments to the public pension
fund have roughly doubled since 2006, from about 10 percent of payroll
to 20 percent." <sup>\[27\]</sup>

A 2016 study found that only 30% of the money that school districts pay
towards the retirement benefits of an educator actually go toward that
educator's pension, with 70% being used to pay off unfunded debt in that
pension system. <sup>\[27\]:1</sup>

### Demands

Universally, demands included raising pay.<sup>\[28\]\[29\]</sup> In
Oklahoma and West Virginia, respectively sources of oil and coal,
demands included financing the increased spending on education through
taxation focused on these industries.<sup>\[30\]\[31\]</sup>

Original reason for the strike included the state's plan to force
teachers to use fitbit to be allowed to keep subscribing to the same
healthplan or face a \$500 annual fine.<sup>\[32\]</sup>
