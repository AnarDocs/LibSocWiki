The **Aboriginal Australian Movement** refers to the
[indigenist](Indigenism "wikilink") movement inside
[Australia](Australia "wikilink"), aiming to preserve aboriginal
cultural sites, abolish racist laws and even create an aboriginal
nation.

## History

In 1965, partially inspired by the 'Freedom Rides' of the US [Civil
Rights Movement](Civil_Rights_Movement_(USA) "wikilink"), Australian
students and Aboriginal activists organised a [freedom
ride](Freedom_Ride_(Australia) "wikilink"), touring the most racist
towns in Australia and documenting conditions of racism against
aboriginals. Occasionally, they were attacked by white supremacists and
these events drew the attention of Australian and international media.
In 1966, aboriginal farmworkers in Gurindji went on strike over
mistreatment. At the end of the 1960s, there was a mass exodus of
aboriginal youth from the countryside and into Sydney, particularly the
neighbourhood of Redfern.

In the 1970s (partially inspired by the [Black Panther
Party](Black_Panther_Party "wikilink") in the US and [Black Power
Revolution](Black_Power_Revolution_(Trinidad_and_Tobago) "wikilink") in
[Trinidad and Tobago](Trinidad_and_Tobago "wikilink")) aboriginal
activists set up free medical clinics, legal aid centres, breakfast for
children programs and housing co-operatives. The aboriginal movement
played a prominent role of boycotting the visiting of a white South
African soccer team in protest of
[Apartheid](Apartheid_South_Africa "wikilink"). The [Aboriginal Tent
Embassy](Aboriginal_Tent_Embassy "wikilink") was established in Canberra
and defended from eviction.
