The **Athenian Polis** or **Athenian Democracy** (594BCE - 322BCE)
refers to a network of [citizen's
assemblies](Democratic_Assembly.md "wikilink") spread out across the city
of [Athens](Hellenic_Republic.md "wikilink") where around a fifth of the
population (as it excluded women, slaves, foreigners and the indebted)
could participate in direct democracy. It is more accurate to refer to
this as a [dual power](Dual_Power.md "wikilink") built in response to
[class struggle](Class_Struggle.md "wikilink") than a [genuinely
libertarian socialist
society](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Societies.md "wikilink").

## History

[Solon](Solon.md "wikilink") was appointed magistrate of Athens in order to
maintain peace as class struggle intensified. He implemented reforms
which laid the basis of the Polis which lasted for centuries. It was
crushed briefly by Spartans in the Peloponnese War, but revolution led
to its restoration again. It was crushed a hundred years later after
Macedonians took the city and destroyed direct democracy in 322BCE.[^1]

## Decision-Making

Athenian men gathered in [assemblies](Democratic_Assembly.md "wikilink")
called *demes*in order to collectively discuss and make decisions that
affected the community as a whole. A
[confederal](Confederation.md "wikilink") model was used as delegates
managed each neighbourhood, scaling up the whole city.[^2]

## Economy

Despite being a slave economy, there were very low taxes and little
restrictions on ownership. People generously and voluntarily contributed
money, resources and labor hours towards public projects that [benefited
everyone](Commons.md "wikilink").[^3] However, it has been argued by [Takis
Fotopoulos](Takis_Fotopoulos.md "wikilink") that slavery ultimately led to
the demise of Athens, creating an apathetic and unproductive population
of slaves.[^4]

## Environmental Protection

Athens struggled with [soil erosion and
deforestation](Ecocide.md "wikilink") due to an already delicate and thin
mountainside plus overgrazing. However, the creation of a
partial-direct-democracy allowed for environmentally-concerned citizens
to convince other citizens to push for ecological restoration. Including
the planting of grape gardens (viticulture) and orchards of fruit
trees.[^5]

## Culture

One serious flaw with Athenian culture was that it practiced
[slavery](slavery.md "wikilink"), was extremely
[patriarchal](Patriarchy.md "wikilink") and enabled authoritarianism to
emerge. Only adult male citizens with military training could vote;
women, slaves, debtors, and all who lacked Athenian blood were excluded.
At the very most, democracy involved less than a fifth of the population
(40,000 people).[^6]

During the time that the Polis existed, Athens made extremely large
strides in the area of culture, philosophy and science to the point that
it is seen as the birthplace of [Western
Civilization](Western_Civilization.md "wikilink") and Western Philosophy by
many. Some of the most major achievements include:

- The philosophy legends of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle.
- The rise of public speaking skills.
- The first developments in atomic theory.
- The first historians and economists.
- The development of the concepts of 'tragedy' and 'comedy' in theatre.
- The reconstruction of several major temples and the great Acropolis of
  Athens.
- The greatest sculptures and statues in the world at that time.
- The greatest military leaders of all time, Alexander the Great and
  Xenophon.[^7]
