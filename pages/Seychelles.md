## History

From 1977 to 2004, the Seychelles practiced [African
Socialism](African_Socialism "wikilink") led by [France-Albert
René](France-Albert_Rene "wikilink") following a bloodless coup by
René's supporters in 1977. This was one of the more successful efforts
at African Socialism, with the country soon scoring the highest HDI in
Africa and having some of the best levels of literacy, life expectancy,
economic development and infant mortality. The country was politically
stable and managed to avoid a coup launched by South Africa and possibly
the CIA. However, the government engaged in several assassinations and
torture of dissidents, but in 2004 René stepped down peacefully and
a representative democracy developed. Since then inequality and poverty
have increased on the islands.
