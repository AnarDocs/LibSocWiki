The **Propaganda Model** is a concept in economics developed by [Noam
Chomsky](Noam_Chomsky "wikilink") and [Edward S.
Herman](Edward_S._Herman "wikilink") about how corporate organisation of
the media creates systematic [biases](Media_Bias "wikilink").

### 1. Ownership

The size and profit-seeking imperative of dominant media corporations
create a bias. Since mainstream media outlets are currently either large
corporations or part of conglomerates (e.g. Westinghouse or General
Electric), the information presented to the public will be biased with
respect to these interests. Such conglomerates frequently extend beyond
traditional media fields and thus have extensive financial interests
that may be endangered when certain information is publicized. According
to this reasoning, news items that most endanger the corporate financial
interests of those who own the media will face the greatest bias and
censorship.
