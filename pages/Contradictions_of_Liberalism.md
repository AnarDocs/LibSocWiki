This article outlines the **contradictions of liberalism**, or the ways
in which [liberal](Liberalism.md "wikilink") governments contradict their
own values. As such, this article takes representative democracy,
capitalism, punitive justice and reformism as justified. Even if as
libertarian socialists we have our own critiques of these concepts.

## General Contradictions

- Liberalism often justifies itself by claiming to have 'checks and
  balances' to prevent a authoritarian regime from coming to power.
  Let's look at all the times that failed in the 20th and 21st centuries
  alone:

- This means that, only 3 out of 3 liberal countries have managed to
  stay completely true to liberal values since their independence or
  overthrowing of a dictator who ruled during independence, they are:
  - In Africa: [Botswana](Botswana.md "wikilink"),
    [Mauritius](Mauritius.md "wikilink"), [Namibia](Namibia.md "wikilink") and
    [Tunisia](Tunisia.md "wikilink"). Meaning that 92% of liberal
    governments have failed to live up to the standards of liberalism.
  - In South America: None, meaning 100% of liberal governments failed
    to live up to liberalism.

## Iceland

- The Icelandic government has repeatedly promised to pull out of
  [NATO](NATO.md "wikilink"), but has failed to deliver on said promise.
- Iceland had major issues of corruption and abuse by the finance sector
  which led to a [revolution in
  2009](Icelandic_Revolution_(2009).md "wikilink").
- Iceland has a very famous case of [police
  misconduct](police_Misconduct.md "wikilink") - The [Reykjavik
  Confessions](Reykjavik_Confessions.md "wikilink").
