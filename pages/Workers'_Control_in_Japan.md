**Workers' Control in Japan** is unfortunately largely unknown among the
Anglophone left, however, we do have access to some information on it.
Unlike [workers' control in most other
countries](Workers'_Control_by_Country "wikilink"), Japan's peaked
following the end of World War II, a trend only [matched in
Indonesia](Workers'_Control_in_Indonesia "wikilink").

## During the Allied Occupation of Japan

*Main Article: [Allied Occupation of
Japan](Allied_Occupation_of_Japan "wikilink")*

Beginning in 1945 under [US occupation](US_Hegemony "wikilink"), a mass
strike wave hit Japan after [trade unions](Trade_Union "wikilink") were
legalised. Around 10% of these involved (or 133 strikes, involving over
100,000 workers) led to work-ins. Many workers were angered at the war
profiteering by Japanese capitalists and argued that the democratisation
of Japan should extend to the workplace.

Workers who took control of their place of work took over all aspects of
production, the buying and selling of their resources and negotiating
with employers. The strikes were extremely peaceful and would cease if
wages were increased (proving the seizing the means doesn't need to kill
anyone, to the anger of capitalists and Leninists a like). The main
industries affected were newspapers, shoe factories, hospitals,coal
mines, municipal government offices and steel works. Wages and
productivity massively rose in the early stages of workers' control, but
often fell after a week or two, this is for two reasons:

1.  Inexperienced workers often increased production at the expense of
    damaging equipment
2.  Workers became increasingly anxious about losing their jobs

One boss who refused to surrender the keys to his plant was locked up in
his office for four days. Such acts as forcing employers to hold
interviews, trespassing or seizing residences, and making unau- thorized
searches for commodity hoards have been regarded as "minor offenses"
which the police condoned. One of the few cases regarded as extreme
involved striking coal miners in Hokkaido who not only took over the
Mitsubishi mines but constituted themselves a "People's Court" to try
their employers and top company officials as war criminals. Trade unions
at various points refused to accept demands and threatened taking over
the entire coal industry if certain demands were not met. Although
initially accepted as profit-sharing and wage increases were given to
the working class, the police began to repress episodes of workers'
control, thus being a perfect example of
[co-optation](co-optation "wikilink").
