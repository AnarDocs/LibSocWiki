## History

### Socialist State (1974 - 1991)

*Main Article: [Socialist Ethiopia](Socialist_Ethiopia.md "wikilink")*

After a [USSR](USSR.md "wikilink")-backed military coup led to the deposing
of the monarchy and creation of a
[Marxist-Leninist](Marxist-Leninism.md "wikilink") state, Ethiopia became
an authoritarian socialist state for 17 years. Although it established a
very successful educational system and gender equality, the government
was largely dependent on aid from the USSR, [East
Germany](East_Germany.md "wikilink") and [Cuba](Cuba.md "wikilink") and faced
several major droughts, famines and insurrections the led to an unstable
regime that eventually collapsed.
