The **Uba Strike of 1937** was a [strike](List_of_Strikes.md "wikilink") by
sugar workers in [Mauritius](Mauritius.md "wikilink") in
[1937](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Southern_Africa.md "wikilink").

## Background

In the 1870s, large sugar estates sold off their less productive land to
Indian Mauritians that formed a small class of landowners called
Sirdars. The [British Empire](British_Empire.md "wikilink") feared angering
the Franco-Mauritian elite for fears the island might join the [French
Empire](French_Empire.md "wikilink") again, making it extremely difficult
for pro-worker reforms to be passed. Many farmers planted the hardier
but less productive Uba variety of sugarcane. Although Uba produced more
cane by weight it also had a lower sucrose content than traditional
varieties of sugarcane meaning that the mills would produce less refined
sugar from it. Since the growers of sugarcane were paid by weight the
sugar refineries experienced lower profits whilst the growers were paid
more per harvest. In July 1937, at the beginning of that year's
sugarcane harvest, the sugar refineries announced that they would only
accept Uba cane for 15% less than regular sugarcane. This combined with
the depressed state of the sugar market internationally put great
economic strain on growers.

## Events

Following the announcement of the fifteen percent reduction in the Uba
cane price workers on the Rich Fund estate asked the Sirdars or managers
to intervene to raise the price. After getting no satisfaction the
workers went on strike and caused a number of minor disturbances. Due to
[similar strikes](British_Caribbean_Strike_Wave_(1930s).md "wikilink") in
the Caribbean at the time the British government in Mauritius initially
sought a conciliatory approach whilst the Labour Party held rallies
calling for political and economic reform. By mid-August the strikes had
spread to other sugar estates across the island. The government sought
to negotiate with the sugar refineries to increase the price of Uba cane
but a few estates refused. One of the estates that refused to increase
the price, the Union-Flacq estate owned by R.Gujadhur, became the target
of arson attacks and property damage. This along with a suggestion by
the police to deal with their own security lead to the stockpiling of
weapons on the estate.

### Massacre

On the 13th of August 1937 around two hundred small farmers and workers
marched on the refinery at Union-Flacq. Armed staff at the refinery met
the demonstrators who then attempted to storm the facility. Fearing for
their personal safety the staff fired on the demonstrators. The
encounter resulted in the deaths of six protesters and wounding four
more. The protesters dispersed whilst setting fire to surrounding sugar
cane fields. Word spread and protests lasted for an additional two weeks
across the island.

## Results

In 1938, the following reforms were passed in Mauritius:

- Legalisation of [trade unions](Trade_Union.md "wikilink")
- Legalisation of [collective
  bargaining](Collective_Bargaining.md "wikilink")
- Creation of institutions to mediate between workers and bosses
