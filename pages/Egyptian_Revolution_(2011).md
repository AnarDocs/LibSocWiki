The **Egyptian Revolution of 2011**, also known as the **January 25
Revolution** was a series of mass protests, revolts and creation of
[popular assemblies](Democratic_Assembly.md "wikilink") in Egypt that led
to the downfall of the dictatorship of Hosni Mubarak, but resulted
eventually in the rise to power of an authoritarian regime after a
lengthy political crisis. It was a central event of the [Arab
Spring](Arab_Spring.md "wikilink") and [Revolutions of 2010 -
2015](Revolutions_of_2010_-_2015.md "wikilink").
