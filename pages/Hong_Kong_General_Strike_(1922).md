The **Hong Kong General Strike of 1922** was a [general
strike](List_of_General_Strikes "wikilink") started by sailors in [Hong
Kong](Hong_Kong "wikilink") in
[1922](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Eastern_Asia "wikilink").

## Background

Hong Kong, a colony of the [British Empire](British_Empire "wikilink")
since [1847](First_Opium_War "wikilink"), saw the quadrupling of prices
in the early 1920s without a wage rise. As revolutions had swept
[China](China "wikilink"), many people in Hong Kong felt agitated, after
bosses refused to concede a 0% wage rise and closed shop, so the
Seamen's Union (SU) went on strike.

## Events

As ships arrived in Hong Kong their crews deserted and joined the
strike. The Union had an armed militia that enforced the strike and
blockaded all food by rail or sea. Tens of thousands of strikers and
their families left Hong Kong for Canton where the local government
housed, fed and paid them a wage. The bosses had to negotiate with the
strike committee by telegraph. The government declared the SU and three
others illegal and brought in scab labour from China. The Union forced
the railway to levy a 30% surcharge on all tickets to support the
strike. On the 28th February the SU called all other workers to join
them. Not only rail workers and stevedores but bakers, cooks, clerks,
coolies and servants joined the strike. The ruling class now had to cook
its own food and queue to buy it. No clothes were washed, no shirts were
ironed. Ministers had to wander government buildings delivering their
own messages but there was no-one to carry out their orders.

The army was called out and commandeered food and vehicles, workers were
pressed into forced labour. With their workforce disappearing, the
bosses banned anyone from leaving Hong Kong, which meant no-one could
visit the graves of their ancestors in China, a fearful thing. A
'freedom' march against the ban led to confrontation, riot and massacre
at Sha Tin.

## Results

The strike led to massive concessions from the government, notably:

- 20% wage increase for sailors
- Sailors union legalised
- Political prisoners freed
- Half-pay for strike days
- Compensation for victims of the massacre of Sha Tin

However, because the bosses stayed in power, they prepared well and
defeated and [even bigger general strike three years
later](Hong_Kong_General_Strike_(1925) "wikilink").
