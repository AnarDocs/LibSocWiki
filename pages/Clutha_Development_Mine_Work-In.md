The **Clutha Development Mine Work-In** was an episode of [workers'
control](Workers'_Self-Management "wikilink") in South Clifton,
[Australia](Commonwealth_of_Australia "wikilink") in
[1972](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Oceania "wikilink"). From
May 8 to 10, 1972, about sixty [miners](Working_Class "wikilink") took
over the Clutha Development mine at South Clifton in defiance of its
official closure on May 5, ensuring the mine was reopened for a further
period; all workers were returned to the
[payroll](Wage_Labour "wikilink") and promised work at other mines after
the impending closure.[^1]
