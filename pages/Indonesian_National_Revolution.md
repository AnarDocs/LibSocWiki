The **Indonesian National Revolution** was an [anti-colonial
revolt](Timeline_of_Anti-Colonialism "wikilink") in
[Indonesia](Indonesia "wikilink") from
[1945](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Southeast_Asia "wikilink")
to 1949, it saw Indonesia liberate itself from the [Dutch
Empire](Dutch_Empire "wikilink"), efforts to create a [social
revolution](Social_Revolution "wikilink") and to create a potentially
socialist Indonesia, which failed.

## Workers' Self-Management

Tailway, plantation and factory workers across Java implemented
[workers' self-management](Workers'_Self-Management "wikilink") from
1945 to 1946, until it was crushed by the new Indonesian Nationalist
Government, who declared the workers to be
[anarcho-syndicalist](Anarcho-Syndicalism "wikilink") traitors.[^1]
Additionally, [Australian](Australia "wikilink") dockworkers [refused to
load 400 Dutch ships](Black_Armada_Ban "wikilink") heading to Indonesia,
cutting off a major supply point that helped Indonesian rebels win the
war.
