The **Black Armada Ban** was a refusal by dockworkers in [Australian
ports](Australia.md "wikilink") to not serve Dutch ships as to assist the
rebels in the [Indonesian
Revolution](Indonesian_National_Revolution.md "wikilink") from [1945 to
1949](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Oceania.md "wikilink").

## Background

Australia's [trade union](Trade_Union.md "wikilink") movement had grown
very largely since the 1890s, with it only getting bigger with the
[Great Depression](Great_Depression.md "wikilink"). With the end of World
War II, [anti-colonial movements](Anti-Colonialism.md "wikilink") swept
European colonies in Asia and Africa, and many trade unionists
sympathised with the desire for the desire for peace and democracy in
other countries. An independence movement in
[Indonesia](Indonesia.md "wikilink") (then a [Dutch
colony](Dutch_Empire.md "wikilink")) launched a revolution with the support
of Indonesian trade unions, who made an international call for
solidarity, which Australian trade unionists responded to.

## Events

The five hundred Indonesian seamen who walked off the ships were housed
in the top floor of the Trades Hall (the dance floor) for three weeks.
Blankets were provided from American stores by Chinese working for the
Americans at Bulimba, and meals were brought from Chinese restaurants.
Many of the Chinese met at the long table in the dining room at our
house on the hill and their leader Albert was the only one, to my
knowledge, who spoke English. They were delighted when my mother and we
three girls waited on them with tea and cakes. On one occasion Albert
took us down to their Bulimba camp where we were surprised to see that
the Chinese seemed to run the camp![^1]

Thousands of returning soldiers added a volatile element to the labour
movement. Australian troops were reported to have graffitied on
buildings and old tanks in Indonesia at the end of the war, “We fought
for freedom—let’s give it to the Indonesians.”[^2]
