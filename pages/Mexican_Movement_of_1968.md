The **Mexican Movement of 1968** or **Movimiento Estudianti** was a
student movement and series of protests demanding greater civil
liberties, [democracy](democracy "wikilink") and a reduction of
[economic inequality](Economic_Inequality "wikilink") in
[Mexico](Mexico "wikilink") in
[1968](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Central_America "wikilink").

## Background

Since the end of the [Mexican
Revolution](Mexican_Revolution "wikilink"), Mexico had been an
authoritarian one-party state that repressed dissenters. However, the
country had been going through an [economic
miracle](Mexican_Miracle "wikilink") and the population became more
education and urbanised, leading to rapid discontent with the
government. Inspired by a recent wave of strikes in the mid-1960s and
the [global unrest in the late
1960s](Revolutions_of_1967_-_1975 "wikilink"), people began to dissent
against the government. In addition, the 1968 olympics were to be held
in Mexico, and many felt that the [money](money "wikilink") would be
better spent elsewhere.

## Events

On the 22nd and 23rd July, 1968, a series of fights between students at
the Vocational Schools 2 and 5 affiliated with the National Polytechnic
Institute (IPN) and the Isaac Ochoterena High School, a preparatory
school affiliated with National Autonomous University of Mexico. Police
violently broke up the fights, arresting students and entereing the
schools. Students and communist protesters organised against the
repression on the 26th of July, in memory of the [26th of July
Movement](26th_of_July_Movement "wikilink") in the [Cuban
Revolution](Cuban_Revolution "wikilink"). Soon, frustrated protesters
set fire to empty buses, leading to hundreds of injuries and arrests.
Students hid in a school and with the police claiming them to be a
threat to national security (due to communist links) they destroyed the
door (from the 18th century) with a rocket launcher.

This is eventually led to a massive student march and the formation of
the National Strike Council, which coordinated protests for social,
educational and political reforms. They also formed brigades (group of
six or more students) who distributed leaflets on the street, markets
and on buses about various issues in the country and spoke about
government corruption and repression. Most drivers and passengers
sympathised with them, and they organised an even larger protest march,
and in response the military occupied the National Autonomous University
of Mexico. The military attempted to occupy two more campuses as
students used small arms and molotov cocktails.

The students held the campuses for more than 12 hours and 15 people were
killed and over a 1,000 bullets were fired. Afterwards a [popular
assembly](Democratic_Assembly "wikilink") of 10,000 people was held in a
major city plaza in Mexico City, before several helicopters dropped
flairs and [massacred](Tlatelolco_Massacre "wikilink") between 300 and
400 people. This was the starting point of the [Mexican Dirty
War](Mexican_Dirty_War "wikilink") and radicalised many people,
including the future organisers of the
[EZLN](Zapatista_Army_of_National_Liberation "wikilink").
