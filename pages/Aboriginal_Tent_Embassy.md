The **Aboriginal Tent Embassy** is a [protest
camp](Protest_Camp.md "wikilink") located in Canberra,
[Australia](Australia.md "wikilink") outside parliament house. Established
in 1972, it has survived for nearly 50 years and continues to advocate
for [Aboriginal Australians](Aboriginal_Australians.md "wikilink").

## History

In response to the refusal to recognise aboriginal land rights, four
Aboriginal men ([Michael Anderson](Michael_Anderson.md "wikilink"), [Billy
Craigie](Billy_Craigie.md "wikilink"), Tony Coorey and Bertie Williams)
arrived in Canberra from Sydney on the 26th of January, 1972 and planted
a beach umbrella on the lawn in front of Parliament House. Soon several
tents emerged and Aboriginal people and non-indigenous supporters came
from all parts of Australia to join the protest. In Feburary the embassy
presented a list of demands to the Australian government:

- Control of the Northern Territory as a State within the Commonwealth
  of Australia; the parliament in the Northern Territory to be
  predominantly Aboriginal with title and mining rights to all land
  within the Territory.
- Legal title and mining rights to all other presently existing reserve
  lands and settlements throughout Australia.
- The preservation of all sacred sites throughout Australia.
- Legal title and mining rights to areas in and around all Australian
  capital cities.
- Compensation money for lands not returnable to take the form of a
  down-payment of six billion dollars and an annual percentage of the
  gross national income.

The police deemed the embassy a [squat](Squatting.md "wikilink") and
evicted it, but three days later, it was retaken and the
[police](police.md "wikilink") could not retake it. It was destroyed in a
storm in 1974 but quickly rebuilt, and was moved to a house in the
nearby suburb of Red Hill, but abandoned in 1977. It was only in 1992
that it was re-established, it has since been subject to many arson
attacks from unknown figures (likely white supremacists or undercover
police).
