The **working class** (sometimes called **popular classes**, **lower
class** or **proletariat**) refers to those in society who are dependent
upon [wage labour](Wage_Labour.md "wikilink") for survival. The liberation
of the working class from wage labour and [democratization of
workplaces](Workers'_Self-Management.md "wikilink") is one of the most
fundamental parts of [libertarian
socialism](Libertarian_Socialism.md "wikilink").
