The **Asari** are a fictional, space-faring species and civilisation in
the [Mass Effect](Mass_Effect_(Video_Game) "wikilink") that employs some
principles of [libertarian
socialism](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Societies "wikilink").

## Decision-Making

According to the *codex* (the in-game lore/wiki)

> The asari came late to the concept of world government. For centuries,
> their homeworld of Thessia was dotted with loose confederacies of
> great republican cities. The closest Earthly equivalent would be the
> ancient Mediterranean [city-states](Athenian_Polis "wikilink"). Since
> the asari culture values [consensus](consensus "wikilink") and
> accommodation, there was little impetus to form larger principalities.
> Rather than hoard resources, the asari bartered freely. Rather than
> attack one another over differing philosophies, they sought to
> understand one another.

> Only in the information age did the city-states grow close.
> Communication over internet evolved into an "electronic democracy".
> Asari have no politicians or elections, but a free-wheeling,
> all-inclusive legislature that citizens can participate in at will.
> Policy debates take place at all hours of the day, in official chat
> rooms and forums moderated by specially-programmed virtual
> intelligences. All aspects of policy are opened to plebiscite at any
> time. In any given debate, the asari tend to lend the most credence to
> the opinions of any Matriarchs present, nearly always deferring to the
> experience of these millennia-old "wise women".

> Achieving consensus through public debate may take too long in a
> crisis. In cases where prompt, decisive action is required, the asari
> defer to the wisdom of local Matriarchs.[^1]

## Crime

One of the not-so libertarian elements of Asari civilisation are the
*Justicars*, an elite class of soldiers and spies that work to brutally
smash criminal rings and terrorists. According to the codex:

> Despite the refinement and sophistication of asari culture,
> criminality remains a fact of life. The asari solution to the most
> vicious and destructive criminal element is the Justicar Order.

> Justicars are an asari class of virtually untouchable, extra-judicial
> executioners operating almost exclusively within asari territory. In
> the last decade alone, Justicars have smashed dozens of criminal rings
> inside asari territory, operated by asari and non-asari alike. Their
> methods range from subtle where possible, to brutal where necessary.

> Trained for extreme strength, biotic capacity, resourcefulness,
> asceticism, and ruthlessness, the fanatical justicars are romanticized
> and feared throughout asari society.

> Although justicars generally work alone, their effectiveness arises
> from the huge body of knowledge they can access. Any asari who enters
> the ranks of justicars has already spent centuries in a combination of
> criminal investigation, military intelligence, and combat experience;
> the collective body of justicar knowledge exceeds even that of the
> Spectres.

> Justicars tend to be independent, requiring little help but also
> scorning it since such advanced skill and experience usually travels
> with a powerful ego. The conflicts presented by such arrogance
> prompted the Justicar Order to develop the Oaths of Subsumation. The
> Oaths pledge protection of the innocent, the punishment of the guilty,
> and defence of common law and the norms of asari society. The effect
> of the Oaths is conservative, ensuring that justicars respect the
> existing distribution of asari power rather than staging a coup to
> rearrange society according to justicar satisfaction. Nevertheless,
> the possibility of such an attack is a source of anxiety -- and
> counter-intelligence -- among the asari elite.

> Of all the pledges, the Third Oath of Subsumation is sworn the least
> of any of the oaths. Requiring a Justicar to swear loyalty that
> overrides the dictates of even the Justicar Code, the Third Oath is
> usually invoked in matters where even the black-or-white thinking of
> justicars is forced to concede the existence of gray.

## Economics

According to the Mass Effect [wiki](wiki "wikilink"):

> The asari possess the largest single economy in the galaxy. They have
> extensive trade and social contacts. Craft guilds, such as those
> within the cities Serrice and Armali, hold a virtual monopoly on
> advanced biotic technology. Given their political influence, an
> embargo by the asari would prove disastrous to the Alliance.[^2]
