TheÂ **Mongolian People's Republic** was a
[Marxist-Leninist](Marxist-Leninism.md "wikilink")
[state](List_of_States.md "wikilink") in what is now
[Mongolia](Mongolia.md "wikilink") that existed from
[1924](Revolutions_of_1916_-_1923.md "wikilink") to
[1992](Revolutions_of_1986_-_1994.md "wikilink").

## History

### Beginnings

Following a complex power struggle that emerged in the country after the
collapse of the Russian and Chinese Empires. In reaction to a theocratic
government, socialist revolutionaries, with the help of Russia, [took
over the government and established a socialist state in
1924](Mongolian_Revolution_(1921).md "wikilink").

### Early Years and World War II

At the time, Mongolia was severely underdeveloped. Industry was
nonexistent and all wealth was controlled by the nobility and religious
establishments. The population numbered less than a million people and
was shrinking due to nearly half of all Mongolian males living in
monasteries.

In 1928, [Joseph Stalin](Joseph_Stalin.md "wikilink") ordered the
collectivisation of Mongolian agriculture. This led to an economic
crisis, which resulted in uprisings in the West and the South that could
only be suppressed with the help of the Soviet Union. After this
failure, livestock remained in private hands. The state began to develop
industry based on processing of animal husbandry products and crop
raising on state farms. Transportation, communications, domestic and
foreign trade, and banking and finance were nationalised or taken over
by [cooperatives](Cooperative.md "wikilink").

In 1934, Peljidiin Genden (first president of socialist Mongolia)
visited Moscow and angrily accused Stalin of "Red imperialism". He
subsequently died in the [Great Purge](Great_Purge_(USSR).md "wikilink")
after being tricked into taking a holiday on the Black Sea. The USSR
also placed soldiers into the country in 1936 in response to aggression
into China by the [Japanese Empire](Japanese_Empire.md "wikilink"). Several
battles occurred on the border in an undeclared war during [World War
II](World_War_II.md "wikilink") and Mongolia's economy became based around
providing resources to the USSR, Mongolian volunteers also fought in the
[Red Army](Red_Army_(USSR).md "wikilink") against [Nazi
Germany](Nazi_Germany.md "wikilink"). Mongolia was also used as the main
base to launch the USSR's invasion of Manchuria, a key point in causing
Japan's surrender.

### Cold War

After World War II, Stalin negotiated Mongolia's independence from the
[Kuomingtang](Kuomingtang.md "wikilink") in China. Mongolia had been an
incredibly isolated country, only remaining in contact with the USSR and
focusing on economic development. It opened up relations with much of
Eastern Europe, [North Korea](North_Korea.md "wikilink") and
[China](China.md "wikilink"). In the 1950s China provided much needed
economic aid, helping to build apartment blocks and infrastructure with
Chinese workers. The country also began massive investment into mining,
timber processing and consumer goods production. However, during the
[Sino-Soviet Split](Sino-Soviet_Split.md "wikilink"), Mongolia firmly sided
with the USSR and the USSR stationed soldiers in the country.

### Collapse

After the attempted liberalisation of the USSR, many university students
in Mongolia took inspiration and launched [massive protests in
1990](Mongolian_Revolution_(1990).md "wikilink"), which led to the
[democratisation](democratisation.md "wikilink") of the country in 1990,
and the end of the Marxist-Leninist state. However, the communists were
only voted out in 1996.

Much like the collapse of most socialist nations, Mongolia's went
through a severe economic crisis, with GDP falling by 80% between 1989
and 1993, population growth also roughly halved. However, Mongolia did
not suffer a noticeable loss of life expectancy.
