The **Anti-Iraq War Protests** began in 2002 against the [invasion of
Iraq](Iraq_War_(2003).md "wikilink"), held in 3,000 cities and towns the
protests

## Results

In the harsh words of [Peter Gelderloos](Peter_Gelderloos.md "wikilink"):
"The movement accomplished nothing. It did not stop or limit the war, it
did not end the occupation, and if it made any real difference in its
participants' lives, it did so without a trace, since they so promptly
abandoned it."[^1]

## Analysis

The failure of the anti-war protests has been attributed to its
exclusive pacifism, focus on protest marches, lack of analysis of the
causes of the Iraq War ([US
Imperialism](Timeline_of_US_Imperialism.md "wikilink") and
[Capitalism](Capitalism.md "wikilink")).
