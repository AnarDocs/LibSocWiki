**Murray Bookchin** (1921 - 2006) was a [libertarian
socialist](List_of_Libertarian_Socialists.md "wikilink"), historian,
philosopher and factory worker. His philosophy has been extremely
influential in modern [democratic](Democratic_Assembly.md "wikilink") and
[environmental movements](Environmentalism.md "wikilink"). Although he
spent most of his life as an anarcho-communist, he developed the
philosophies of [social ecology](Social_Ecology.md "wikilink"), [dialectal
naturalism](Dialectical_Naturalism.md "wikilink") and [libertarian
municipalism](Libertarian_Municipalism.md "wikilink"), and finally
abandoned the anarchist movement to develop
[communalism](communalism.md "wikilink") as a distinct philosophy.
