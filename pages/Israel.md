The **State of Israel**is a [liberal](Liberalism.md "wikilink"),
[capitalist](Capitalism.md "wikilink") [state](List_of_States.md "wikilink")
located in Western Asia, bordering the other states of
[Egypt](Egypt.md "wikilink"), [Jordan](Jordan.md "wikilink"),
[Syria](Syria.md "wikilink") and [Lebanon](Lebanon.md "wikilink"). It also the
only state that is built on the principles of
[Zionism](Zionism.md "wikilink") (well, there is [one interesting
region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Autonomous_Oblast) of
[Russia](Russia.md "wikilink")), an ideology that desires the return of a
Jewish state in the Levant to build a [Jewish](Judaism.md "wikilink")
homeland. Support for Israel is an extremely divisive issue which is
prone to provoke arguments online. Supporters view it as a bastion of
liberal democracy, gender equality, scientific progress, secularism and
economic equality in a region where those factors are sorely lacking,
aswell as a liberation project for Jews.

## The Good

- In the area it is in, Israel is the most progressive and liberal
  democratic country. It does have a degree of multi-culturalism, a
  welfare state, LGBT protections and women's rights that are far
  stronger than its neighbours. It is a multiparty system, has everyone
  from Anarchist Jews to Arabs (sometimes Islamists, sadly) to Orthodox
  Jews in the government and then some.
- Israel has assassinated a number of Nazis and protected Jews from
  antisemitic attacks across the world. As
  [anti-fascists](Anti-Fascism.md "wikilink") and anti-antisemites, we can
  appreciate this. Israel has taken Jewish refugees from across Asia and
  Africa to protect them from persecution, saving many, many lives.

## The Bad

*Main Article: [Criticism of Israel](Criticism_of_Israel.md "wikilink")*

- Israel is a liberal, capitalist state, things which are opposed by
  libertarian socialists.
- Israel is a massive participant in the global arms/guns trade, being
  the greatest per capita producing of arms per capita.
- Israel has engaged in around 200 extrajudicial assassinations across
  30 countries. While many were terrorists, plenty of innocent people
  have been harmed.

## Bad Criticism of Israel

*See Also: [Jewish Conspiracy
Theories](Jewish_Conspiracy_Theories.md "wikilink")*

Any attempt to criticise Israel which does the following should be
considered "bad faith" criticism of Israel:

- Any effort to associate all Jews with Israel or the concept of being
  Jewish. Numerous Jews inside and outside of Israel are critical of the
  country.
- Any effort to associate all flavours of [Zionism](Zionism.md "wikilink")
  with Israel.
- Any effort to imply Israel controls the world or even other countries.
  Not only are multiple countries outwardly anti-Israel but even close
  allies like the USA have opposed Israeli interests before. Notably in
  1956 and 1996.
- Efforts to attack Jews right to a state as less then other countries.
  Israel is a nation-state of the Jewish people (which doesn't even
  include Judea fully). France is not attacked for being a French
  Nation-state, so neither should Israel.
