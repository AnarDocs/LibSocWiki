**Çayönü** **Tepesi** an early city in Anatolia (now owned by the
[state](State_(Polity) "wikilink") of [Turkey](Turkey "wikilink")) that
experienced a [revolution](revolution "wikilink") with elements of
[anarchism](anarchism "wikilink"), [feminism](feminism "wikilink") and
[communism](Anarcho-Communism "wikilink").

## History

The site of Çayönü Tepesi was originally settled by
[hunter-gatherer](Hunter-Gatherer "wikilink") groups around 8800 to
8500BCE, with agriculture being developed in 8000BCE and domestication
of Sheep in 7300BCE. The resulting society was deeply
[hierarchical](Social_Hierarchy "wikilink") with a strong
[patriarchy](patriarchy "wikilink").

Society was divided between three manorial houses surrounded by
beautiful sculptures and monuments and the rest of society, which lived
in poor slums. The manors had access to wealth and weapons, whilst the
poor labored in difficult conditions, performing human sacrifices and
engaging in wars with nearby communities.

In [7200BCE](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism "wikilink"), the manors
were burned down as the lower classes living in the slums rebelled
against the [ruling class](Ruling_Class "wikilink"), which were then
converted in municipal waste dumps. The slums dissapeared and new houses
were erected, each with adequate facilities and of equal size,
indicating social equality. The communist and ecologically-oriented
society existed for around 3,000 years.[^1]
