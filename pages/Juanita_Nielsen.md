**Juanita Joan Nielsen** was a wealthy [journalist](Media.md "wikilink")
and [environmentalist](List_of_Environmentalists.md "wikilink") based in
Sydney, [Australia](Australia.md "wikilink"). She disappeared in 1975 in
mysterious circumstances, and is
[suspected](Conspiracy_Theory.md "wikilink") to have been
[murdered](List_of_Assasinations.md "wikilink") for her attempts to expose
[police corruption](Police_Corruption_by_State.md "wikilink") and support
for the [Green Bans](Green_Bans.md "wikilink").

## Life

### Early Life

Born to Neil Donovan Smith, an English-born heir to the Mark Foy's
retail fortune via his parents and Vilma Grace Smith. Her parents
separated soon after her birth and she was raised by her maternal
grandmother at Killara, Sydney. She went to Ravenswood School for Girls,
Gordon, Sydney and worked at Mark Foy's from 1953 until she traveled
abroad in 1959. In 1962, she married a [Danish](Denmark.md "wikilink")
merchant seaman Jorgen Fritz Nielsen at Kobe, [Japan](Japan.md "wikilink")
although the marriage only lasted for around three years. Nielsen
returned to Sydney in 1965 and returned to work at Mark Foy's for about
five years.

### Journalism

In the early 1970s, she set up the newspaper *NOW* based around the
Sydney suburb of Kings Cross that pushed left-wing viewpoints and
strongly supported the [Green Bans](Green_Bans.md "wikilink"). Dozens of
people were to be evicted from her street to make way for a new
apartment complex built by a construction company linked to the Mafia.
The community got the [BLF](Builders_Labourers_Federation.md "wikilink") to
[enact a Green Ban](Kings_Cross_Green_Ban.md "wikilink") and Juanita used
her newspaper to publicise the issue.

After the Green Ban was broken in 1974 as the BLF's conservative federal
leadership dismissed the radical leaders of the New South Wales branch.
Juanita managed to organised the Water Board Union to impose their own
Green Ban, and she began to be harassed and stalked by thugs employed by
local organised crime groups connected to the construction industry.

### Disappearance

On the 4th of July, 1975, Juanita entered the Carousel Nightclub in
Kings Cross to discuss an advertising deal after being invited by Eddie
Trigg, a worker at the club. It was owned by Abe Saffron, who owned
several bars, nightclubs and strip clubs across Sydney and the manager,
James Anderson, owed a lot of money to Frank Theeman, the owner of the
construction company that wanted to build in Kings Cross. She had
previously been invited, but did not show up. She instructed her friends
to stay updated on her wearabouts. Upon entering the club, she was never
seen again. The only clue being her handbag found abandoned near a
freeway in Sydney's western suburbs.

#### Theory \#1: Organised Crime

Evidence pointing to organised crime groups being involved in the
disappearance include:

- Marilyn King, the former girlfriend of Eddie, told a journalist Eddie
  returned home that day with blood on his clothes, and a bloody receipt
  signed by Juanita.
- James Anderson, the manager of the nightclub, was unable to verify his
  alibi. He claimed he was on holiday in Queensland but it was claimed
  he was seen in Sydney.

#### Theory \#2: Corrupt Police

Evidence pointing to corrupt police being involved in the disappearance
include:

- The receptionist, Loretta Crawford, claimed she saw [Fred
  Krahe](Fred_Krahe.md "wikilink"), a local corrupt cop standing over
  Juanita's body holding a pistol over he head which had a bullet-sized
  hole. However, Loretta has repeatedly changed her story. In her
  defence, she has claimed that it was to prevent harassment from her
  former boss, James Anderson. After his death in 2013, she has kept a
  consistent story.
- Juanita's ex-boyfriend claimed she had a list of corrupt dealings by
  the police which went missing after her disappearance. He also claimed
  she had received threatening telephone threats.

Keep in mind it's entirely possible for corrupt police and organised
crime to have worked together. Which is what Loretta Crawford alleges.
