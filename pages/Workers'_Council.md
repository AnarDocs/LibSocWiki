**Workers' councils** are organisations that govern industry or a
municaplity made up of temporary and instantly revocable
[delegates](delegates "wikilink") elected in the region's workplaces. A
variation is a **soldiers' council**, when the delegates are chosen
amongst ([mutinous](Mutiny "wikilink")) soldiers. A mix of workers and
soldiers have also existed
