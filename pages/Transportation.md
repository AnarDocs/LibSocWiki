**Transport** or **Transportation** is the movement of humans, animals
and goods from one location to another. In other words the action of
transport is defined as a particular movement of an organism or thing
from a point A to a Point B. Modes of transport include air, land (rail
and road), water, cable, pipeline and space. The field can be divided
into infrastructure, vehicles and operations.

## Transportation in a Libertarian Socialist Society

Some have argued that a libertarian socialist society would not be able
to coordinate the complex networks and services that make up a modern
transportation system, Friedrich Engels argued in his essay *'[On
Authority](On_Authority_(Book).md "wikilink")*' who claimed that attempting
to institute anarchist control of railways and shipping would simply
lead to their collapse and thus the downfall of modern civilisation. Do
Engels’ claims stand up to the evidence? Let’s find out.

In Revolutionary Spain, the
[CNT](National_Confederation_of_Labour_(Spain).md "wikilink") decided to
integrate and consolidate all transportation into an efficient system
without waste. This improvement meant better facilities, rights of way,
and incomparably better service for the riding public. Fares were
reduced from 15 to 10 cents, with free transportation for school
children, wounded militiamen, those injured at work, other invalids, and
the aged. 

Under socialized transportation better service was provided for more
riders (an increase of 50 million trips in one year). Before the
Revolution only 2% of supplies for maintenance and repairs were
manufactured by the privately owned company. Under socialization, within
only one year, 98% of the repair supplies were made in the socialized
shops. The CNT also provided free [medical
services](Healthcare.md "wikilink"), including clinics and home nursing
care, for the workers and their families.

The railways across Catalonia were also significantly improved, they
were repaired from the fighting as anarchist workers opted to organise a
non-hierarchical organisation to control the railroads, composed of
three sections, traffic, technical/engineering and administration. These
groups were responsible for the training of new workers, cleaning trains
and equipment, upkeep of locomotive depots; freight and passenger
equipment, and repair shops, provision of electricity, fuel (coal and
oil) and tracking trains and communicating between drivers through
telegraphs and telephones.[^1]

In Sri Lanka from 1958 to 1979, self-management was introduced to the
[Sri Lanka Transport Board](Sri_Lanka_Transport_Board.md "wikilink") in
order to improve service, efficiency and morale. Construction material,
fuel and vehicles were all [standardised](Standardisation.md "wikilink") to
ensure easier repairs and replacements, whilst morale among drivers and
maintenance workers increased allowing for the smooth functioning of the
world’s largest bus service (7,000 buses serving 4,000,000 commuters a
day) to function smoothly, delivering on-time bus services, clean buses
and few accidents.

Upon the neoliberal reforms to the country in the late 1970s (in line
with a global decline in [social
democracy](Social_Democracy.md "wikilink")), self-management was abolished
as a new class of [managers](Boss.md "wikilink") was introduced, destroying
morale and leading to more mistakes in the chain of command, leading to
damage in buses. By the 2000s, the board had declined massively and gets
a letter every day about overloaded buses, buses going too fast,
dangerous driving, rude staff and high fees.[^2]

The [Egged Israel Transport Cooperative Society
Ltd](Egged_(Cooperative).md "wikilink") or Egged, founded in 1933, provides
about 35% of Israel's public transport services, employs about 6,500
workers and operates a fleet of 2,950 buses. Egged buses transport about
900,000 passengers per day. Egged also operates some 1,500 buses in
[Poland](Poland.md "wikilink"), where it operates some 215 buses for public
transportation and serves around 40 routes daily. Although run in a way
that libertarian socialists advocate for, it is condemned by libertarian
socialists, as Egged bus drivers have assisted the IDF by delivering
supplies to soldiers in [Israel’s](Israel.md "wikilink") various colonial
wars.[^3]
