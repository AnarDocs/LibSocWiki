**Revolutionary Spain** refers to a period when of the [Spanish Civil
War](Spanish_Civil_War.md "wikilink") where much of the eastern half of
[Spain](Spain.md "wikilink") began experimenting with [libertarian
socialist](Libertarian_Socialism.md "wikilink") ideas with around 8,000,000
people from [1936 to
1939](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Southern_Europe.md "wikilink").
Making it the [largest experiment in libertarian socialist
politics](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Societies.md "wikilink") in the
last 100 years, being most strongly influenced by
[anarcho-syndicalism](Anarcho-Syndicalism.md "wikilink"). The extent,
effectiveness, sustainability, economics, implications and lessons of
the revolution have been heavily studied and debated since the 1930s.

## Public Services

### Healthcare

The Health Workers’ Union was founded in September, 1936 and 8,000
health-workers joined, including doctors, nurses, dentists, midwives,
student doctors, pharmacists, veterinarians and specialized doctors.
Catalonia was divided into nine zones for healthcare: Barcelona,
Tarragona, Lerida, Reus, Borghida, Ripoll, and Haute Pyréenées. The
anarchists made sure that everyone in the region received adequate,
up-to-date medical care. The anarchists opened six new hospitals in
Barcelona, and either new sanitariums were built have former luxury
mansions across the forests and mountains of Catalonia. One of them, for
the treatment of tuberculosis, was considered among the best
installations anywhere.[^1]

## Environmental Protection

Upon forming agricultural cooperatives and communes,
[peasants](peasants.md "wikilink") used methods that were similar to
[permaculture](permaculture.md "wikilink"), using multiple plants to
increase yields and improve soil health, such as putting shade-tolerant
plants under orange trees.[^2] Various metal
[factories](Factory.md "wikilink") were shut down after doctors discovered
links between factory pollution and tuberculosis.[^3] [Daniel
Guérin](Daniel_Guérin.md "wikilink") describes environmental protections
further:

> After the Revolution the land was brought together into rational
> units, cultivated on a large scale and according to the general plan
> and directives of agronomists. The studies of agricultural technicians
> brought about yields 30 to 50 percent higher than before. The
> cultivated areas increased, human, animal, and mechanical energy was
> used in a more rational way, and working methods perfected. Crops were
> diversified, irrigation extended, reforestation initiated, and tree
> nurseries started. Piggeries were constructed, rural technical schools
> built, and demonstration farms set up, selective cattle breeding was
> developed, and auxiliary agricultural industries put into operation.
> Socialized agriculture showed itself superior on the one hand to
> large-scale absentee ownership, which left part of the land fallow;
> and on the other to small farms cultivated by primitive techniques,
> with poor seed and no fertilizers.[^4]
