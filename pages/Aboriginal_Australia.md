**Aboriginal Australia** refers to the societies that were constructed
by [Aboriginal Australians](Aboriginal_Australians.md "wikilink") in
[Australia](Australia.md "wikilink") before Australia became colonised by
the [British Empire](British_Empire.md "wikilink"). Composed of 500
different indigenous nations that all spoke varying languages and wildly
different cultural and economic practices, it would be impossible to
delve into all of them but we do aim to provide a general overview.
