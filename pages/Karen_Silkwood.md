**Karen Gay Silkwood** was a chemical technician and [trade
union](Trade_Union "wikilink") activist known for raising concerns about
corporate practices related to health and safety in a nuclear facility.
After testifying to the Atomic Energy Commission about her concerns and
driving to meet with a *New York Times* journalist and an official of
her union's national office, she died in a car crash under unclear
circumstances.

## Life

Born in Texas, she married William Meadows, an oil pipeline worker, with
whom she had three children. Following the couple's bankruptcy due to
Meadows' overspending, and in the face of Meadows' refusal to end an
extramarital affair, Silkwood left Meadows in 1972 and moved to Oklahoma
City, where she briefly worked as a hospital clerk.

After being hired at the Kerr-McGee Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site plant
near Crescent, Oklahoma, in 1972, Silkwood joined the local Oil,
Chemical & Atomic Workers Union and took part in a strike at the plant.
After the strike ended, she was elected to the union's bargaining
committee, the first woman to achieve that position at the Kerr-McGee
plant. She was assigned to investigate health and safety issues. She
discovered what she believed to be numerous violations of health
regulations, including exposure of workers to contamination, faulty
respiratory equipment and improper storage of samples.

## Death

Later that evening, Silkwood's body was found in her car, which had run
off the road and struck a culvert on the east side of State Highway 74,
180 meters south of the intersection with West Industrial Road. The car
contained none of the documents she held in the union meeting at the Hub
cafe. She was pronounced dead at the scene in what was believed to be an
accident. The trooper at the scene remembers that he found one or two
tablets of the sedative methaqualone in the car, and he remembers
finding cannabis. The police report indicated that she fell asleep at
the wheel.

### Evidence for a Conspiracy

Some pointers to a conspiracy around her death include:

- Key documents related to her efforts to expose the health and safety
  violations were missing from the car. Multiple family members and
  friends confirmed she had the documents with her and took them in her
  car. The documents have never been found.
- The coroner found 0.35 milligrams of methaqualone per 100 milliliters
  of blood at the time of her death — an amount almost twice the
  recommended dosage for inducing drowsiness.
- Skid marks from Silkwood's car were present on the road, suggesting
  that she was trying to get back onto the road after being pushed from
  behind
- Investigators also noted damage on the rear of Silkwood's vehicle
  that, according to Silkwood's friends and family, had not been present
  before the accident. As the crash was entirely a front-end collision,
  it did not explain the damage to the rear of her vehicle.
- A microscopic examination of the rear of Silkwood's car showed paint
  chips that could have come only from a rear impact by another vehicle.
  Silkwood's family claimed to know of no accidents of any kind that
  Silkwood had had with the car, and that the 1974 Honda Civic she was
  driving was new when purchased and no insurance claims were filed on
  that vehicle.
- According to her family, she had received several threatening phone
  calls very shortly before her death.
- One of the investigators disappeared under "mysterious circumstances".
- One of the witnesses committed suicide shortly before she was to
  testify against the Kerr-McGee Corporation about the alleged
  happenings at the plant
- Silkwood family's legal team were followed, threatened with violence,
  and physically assaulted.

However, if she was assassinated as part of a conspiracy. Her killers
are not known, the nuclear plant and the CIA have been suggested, with
one author alleging a secret underground plutonium-smuggling ring
(explaining the 30kg in missing plutonium from the plant), in which many
government agencies, including the highest levels of government and
international intelligence agencies CIA, MI5, Israeli Mossad, and a
"shadowy group of Iranians" were involved.
