**Arthur Caron** (1883 - 1914) was an [anarchist](Anarchism "wikilink")
and a member of the [Industrial Workers of the
World](Industrial_Workers_of_the_World "wikilink"). He masterminded an
attempt to assassinate John D. Rockefeller using a bomb constructed from
dynamite. While building the device, [he was killed
along](Lexington_Avenue_Explosion "wikilink") with Carl Hanson, and
Charles Berg on July 4, 1914, when his bomb prematurely exploded. The
blast also killed a renter of the building who was not part of the plot
and injured dozens of others. In the wake of Caron's death, some 5,000
mourners gathered in New York's Union Square, where anarchist leaders
[Alexander Berkman](Alexander_Berkman "wikilink") and Rebecca Edelson
among others spoke in memory of those who died.[^1]
