## Positives and Negatives

### Positives

- Norway has the most humane prison system in the world at
  [Bastøy](Bastøy_Prison "wikilink") and
  [Halden](Halden_Prison "wikilink").
- In 2018, Norway suspended the sale of arms to [Saudi
  Arabia](Saudi_Arabia "wikilink") in protest of their actions in the
  [Yemeni Civil War](Yemeni_Civil_War "wikilink"). Of course, this also
  counts as a partial negative, as they sold guns to a country that
  gives weapons to ISIS and beheads gay people.[^1]

### Negatives

- Norway has strong issues with violating the land rights of indigenous
  Sámi people.
  - Government authorities and NATO have built bombing-practice ranges
    in Sámi areas in northern Norway and Sweden. These regions have
    served as reindeer calving and summer grounds for thousands of
    years, and contain many ancient Sámi sacred sites.
