The **Gamonal Uprising** or **Gamonal Conflict** was a [working class
uprising](List_of_Libertarian_Socialist_Revolutions.md "wikilink") in the
neighborhood of Gamonal in the city of Burgos, [Spain](Spain.md "wikilink")
in
[2014](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Southern_Europe.md "wikilink").

## Background

Gamonal was a largely working class neighborhood that the local
government and real estate developers attempted to
[gentrify](Gentrification.md "wikilink") the neighborhood by construction
of a new boulevard. Anger stemmed from government corruption, the use of
public money for private gain while [cutting off school and hospital
services](Austerity.md "wikilink") for claims that they couldn't be
afforded and the loss of free parking spaces. There were several
peaceful protests and petitions but they were ineffective.[^1]

## Uprising

The Uprising began on the 10th of January, as protesters physically
blocked construction workers from working on the project. They were
evicted by [police](police.md "wikilink"), and protesters attacked the
police with rocks, leading to a riot. Over the next few days, every
night saw the burning of police cars and police stations, sabotage of
construction equipment and attacking banks. The Mayor of the city
condemned the violence but on the 14th of January agreed to the
protesters demands, pleading with them to stop their violence (which
killed no one).[^2]

## Result

The uprising succeeded in stopping the development project, preventing
an increase in rents and prices in the area.[^3]
