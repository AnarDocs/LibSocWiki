**Harold B. Barclay** (1924 - 2017) was an
[anthropologist](Anthropology.md "wikilink") and
[anarchist](Anarchism.md "wikilink") theorist, specialising in tribal
[North
Africa](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Northern_Africa.md "wikilink").

## Life

Barclay was born near Boston and received his PhD from Cornell after
being a conscientious objector in [World War
II](World_War_II.md "wikilink"). Early in his career he lived and traveled
extensively in the Middle East and Africa and spent two years at the
American University of Cairo.

Prof. Barclay joined the Anthropology Department at the University of
Alberta in 1967 after teaching at Knox College and University of Oregon.
He decided to move to Canada because he was opposed to the [war in
Vietnam](Vietnam_War.md "wikilink"), and the chair of the Sociology
Department Gordon Hirabayashi, whom he had met in Cairo, helped him
obtain a position in the newly-created Anthropology Department. In
addition to doing research on rural society in modern Egypt and the
northern Arab Sudan, Prof. Barclay did ethnographic research in Alberta
which he described as a “goldmine of religious diversity.” He published
extensively in the field of political anthropology, including some
well-regarded books on anarchy.

Prof. Barclay retired from the University of Alberta in 1989, and he and
his wife traveled extensively before settling in Vernon, B.C.
Canada.[^1]
