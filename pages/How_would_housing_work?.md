![](HousinginOntario.png "HousinginOntario.png") **How would housing
work?** is a [frequently asked
question](Introduction_to_Libertarian_Socialism#FAQ.md "wikilink") about
[libertarian socialism](Libertarian_Socialism.md "wikilink").

## General Idea

Libertarian Socialists tend to believe that
[housing](housing.md "wikilink") is a right of all people. We aim to give
people high-quality housing either for free or at an extremely low cost
and if we succeed, we will eliminate high [rents](Rent.md "wikilink"),
[homelessness](homelessness.md "wikilink") and low-quality housing (with
infestations of [animals](Animal.md "wikilink") and things that aren’t
maintained properly, which can lead to [health
problems](Health.md "wikilink"), [structural collapse and
fires](Disasters.md "wikilink")). Not only this, but we desire *tenant’s
control* (or *tenant’s democrac*y or *tenant’s self-management*) in the
same way [we demand it for
workers](Workers'_Self-Management.md "wikilink"). Tenants can control their
housing in the same way workers would in our society, through
[democratic assemblies](Democratic_Assembly.md "wikilink") or by electing
their landlord.

## Historical Examples

### Housing Cooperatives

Research from Toronto, [Canada](Canada.md "wikilink") found that housing
cooperatives had residents rate themselves as having the highest quality
of life and housing satisfaction of any housing organisation in the
city.[^1] Other research among older residents from rural
[USA](United_States_of_America.md "wikilink") found that those living in
housing cooperatives felt much safer, independent, satisfied with life,
had more friends, had more privacy, were healthier and had things
repaired faster.[^2]

[Australian](Australia.md "wikilink") researchers found that cooperative
housing built stronger [social networks](Social_Network.md "wikilink") and
support, as well as better relationships with neighbours compared to
other forms of housing. They cost 14% less for residents and had lower
rates of debt and vacancy. Other research has found that housing
cooperatives tended to have higher rates of building quality, building
safety, feelings of security among residents, lower
[crime](crime.md "wikilink") rates, stable access to housing and
significantly lower costs compared to conventional housing.[^3]

### Marinaleda

[Marinaleda](Marinaleda.md "wikilink"), a town of 3,000 people located in
Southern [Spain](Spain.md "wikilink"), shows us what a new world of housing
can look like. Although making an economic transition in
[1979](Timeline_of_Libertarian_Socialism_in_Southern_Europe.md "wikilink")
due to mass protests, [strikes](Strike.md "wikilink") and [land
occupations](Occupation_(Protest).md "wikilink"), it rose to fame in the
early 2010s in the midst of a massive economic crisis and housing bubble
in Spain. The town had full employment from self-managed farms and
factories and no [police](police.md "wikilink") force (being called a
"utopia for peace").

Houses of three bedrooms and gardens of 100 m2 could be lived in for 15
euros per month. The local government bought all the land around the
town and public grants and free assistance from professional builders is
provided. Zero homelessness has been achieved and the town has built a
school, a TV station, a radio station, parks, childcare centers, aged
care homes, [doctors offices](Healthcare.md "wikilink") and a swimming pool
since the transition.[^4]

### Squatter Communities

*See also: [List of Squats](List_of_Squats.md "wikilink")*

Squatter communities also offer us an alternative vision of housing. In
[Barcelona](Barcelona.md "wikilink"), the famous [squatter
community](Barcelona_Squatter_Community.md "wikilink") manages to organise
free housing for thousands of people. Abandoned or rotting buildings are
fixed by squatters who teach themselves the skills they need along the
way, they fix up their new houses, cleaning, patching roofs, installing
windows, toilets, showers, light, kitchens, and anything else they need.
They often pirate electricity, water, and internet, and much of their
food comes from dumpster-diving, stealing, and squatted gardens.

Besides fixing up their own houses, squatters also work for their
neighborhoods and enrich their communities. Some social centers host
bicycle repair workshops, enabling people to repair or build their own
bicycles, using old parts. Others offer workshops on carpentry,
self-defense and yoga, natural healing, as well as libraries, gardens,
communal meals, art and theater groups, language classes, alternative
media and counterinformation, music shows, movies, computer labs where
people can use the [internet](internet.md "wikilink") and learn
programming. Nearly all of these services are provided absolutely free
for the neighbourhood, which most non-squatters view as beneficial.[^5]
