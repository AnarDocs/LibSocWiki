## Life

### Family

Naomi's family is of [German](Federal_Republic_of_Germany "wikilink")
Jewish heritage, and her grandparents were outspoken
[communists](Communism "wikilink") with a strong interest in [racial
equality](Anti-Racism "wikilink"). Her mother was a documentary
filmmaker with a strong focus on [feminism](feminism "wikilink"), and
her father was a doctor, both of whom described themselves as
[hippies](Hippy_Movement "wikilink"). They both grew up in the
[USA](United_States_of_America "wikilink") (In Newark and Philadelphia)
but moved to Montreal, [Canada](Canada "wikilink") in 1967 to avoid the
[draft](Conscription "wikilink") for the [Vietnam
War](Vietnam_War "wikilink").

### Early Life

Naomi actively rejected politics as a child and teenager, finding it
daunting to have a famous feminist mother. She embraced a life of
consumerism and spent her teenage years within shopping malls.

### Political Development

Naomi developed an interested in politics for two reasons:

1.  Her mother having a stroke and having to care of her when she was
    only 17, taking a year off school to do so.
2.  The 1989 Ã‰cole Polytechnique massacre of female engineering students
    by an anti-feminist triggered a 'wake up call to feminism'.
