## Quotes

"Oh you woman! who is capable and willing to spread the seed of justice;
do not hesitate, do not fret, do not run away, go forward! And for the
benefit of the future generations place the first stone for the building
of social equality in a serene but firm way, with all the right that
belongs to you, without looking down, since you are no longer the
ancient material or intellectual slave."[^2]
