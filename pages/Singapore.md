[capitalist](Capitalism.md "wikilink")
[city-state](List_of_States.md "wikilink") located in Southeast Asia,

## Positives

- Multiculturalism is enshrined into law and is considered very
  successful.
- Singapore has a life expectancy of 83.1 years (3rd highest in the
  world, after [Japan](Japan.md "wikilink") and
  [Switzerland](Switzerland.md "wikilink")).
- In 1996, Singapore legalised being transgender and several health
  clinics were built to help with gender reassignment surgery and
  hormone therapy. However, discrimination against transgender people
  still remains in some of the medical community and broader public,
  meaning many transgender people have to go to Bangkok,
  [Thailand](Thailand.md "wikilink").

## Negatives

  imperialism](Timeline_of_US_Imperialism.md "wikilink"), with Changai
  Naval Base being used to dock US aircraft carriers.
- Homosexuality is criminalised in Singapore and conversion therapy
  groups have recieved state funding.[^1]
- Singapore has been identified as a hotbed for [human
  trafficking](Human_Trafficking.md "wikilink"), with women from
  [India](India.md "wikilink"), [China](China.md "wikilink"),
  [Thailand](Thailand.md "wikilink"), [Vietnam](Vietnam.md "wikilink"),
  [Cambodia](Cambodia.md "wikilink") and [the
  Philippines](the_Philippines.md "wikilink") being kidnapped or coerced to
  Singapore to be sold into prostitution or sexual slavery.[^2]
- Migrant workers from surrounding countries are often heavily exploited
  by [bosses](Boss.md "wikilink") and not protected by labor laws, being
  pushed into harsh conditions.
- Singapore has one of the highest uses of Death Penalty in the world,
  having executed 400 people between 1991 and 2003 for various crimes.
